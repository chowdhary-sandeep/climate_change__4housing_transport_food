It is also plastered with solar cells.\n\nEven if you consider the photovoltaics a gimmick, that's still the best offer in terms of price/performance I've seen poised for market entry in the near future. Until today, that is. The Fit EV as described at €15,500 is a spectacular offer. Makes me wonder if there'll be a mandatory battery rental involved, though...",

I wanted to get some feedback and some comments on a couple evs from their owners.\n\nWe live in south Mississippi.\n\nOur budget is around $60,000 however we could stretch closer to $70,000 for the perfect car.\n\n I have been looking at the Model Y, Model 3, EV6, and Mach-e.\n\nPlan on getting something by the end of the year if possible.\n\nMy minimum daily mileage is 15 miles, however with my job it is not uncommon for me to drive 50-150 miles a day.\n\nWe live in a single-family home and I plan on installing a home charger for overnight charging.\n\nI normally carry around my IT equipment with me so I would prefer something with more cargo space, specifically I would like something with a frunk. That way I could put my equipment in there and not have it take up cabin space. I would like to take trips in the car so would prefer something that could carry 3 suitcases.\n\nI would love to hear all of your opinions and advice. Thanks in advance!",

Actually, it looks like the EV would almost fit in the back of the truck!\n\nIt might have, but the issue would be how to keep it there. So when I hauled it up to Seattle, I used [a trailer to do the job](http://i.imgur.com/cLxJC7K.jpg).\n\n|I agree that I should up the ante and get a meter for measuring charging electricity consumption. As I stated in the post, I wanted to use the measurements that would be available to anyone who has the car, at least at first.\n\nAppliance meters are SO cheap -- about $30, I believe -- especially if you're using a Level 1 charger. If you wind up getting a Level 2 charger, then do two things. First, don't have it hard-wired. Instead, have your electrician run a 240 circuit, so you can simply plug in your Level 2 charger to an outlet. Leviton makes a good Level 2 charger that offers the option of hard-wire or plug. Then find the Watts Up site and get a \"UO\" meter, which will handle 240v. It comes with an ethernet cable that plugs into your computer and dumps all the results. There some ins and outs, but if you can figure out regressions you'll figure that stuff out.\n\n|I haven't really used the Carwings site, but from what I've read, the numbers on the dash can differ, sometimes significantly, from the Carwings data. For one, Carwings calculates distance using GPS while the car uses its odometer. Additionally, they seem to differ in how they calculate the battery capacity. Different people think one or the other is more accurate, but you can certainly expect some people to be biased towards whichever number is better. I don't really trust either, and the way I figure it, the farther you are from the odometer and the raw electric current going into the car, the less accurate your measurements are going to be.\n\nI really agree. Not only all that, but people actually *pay* at the outlet, not at Carwings or at their dashboard. And an appliance meter? There's no question about its accuracy. Same for odometers, which have to meet specific legal standards for non-tamperability.\n\n|No, I don't preheat the car. I'm crazy like that. I used to walk to work through wind, rain, or snow, so a little cold in a 15-minute drive doesn't bother me. I did try preheating a couple times, but it ended up being worse for heater use because the windshield would immediate frost up and I'd have to use the defroster all the way to work. The frost would build up more for my drive home, too.\n\nInteresting stuff.",

        "comment": "I haven't had them for a full year yet.  I had them installed in November, so the initial generation was during the winter (the weakest time for solar).  They didn't cover the bill at the time, since I had not built up credit hours in the summer.  They did still reduce the bill.\n\nSince February/March it has completely covered my bill, all except the bare minimum to be connected to the grid (about 9 dollars in total).  And at this rate I should have enough credits (net metering) to cover this winter as well.  \n\nEdit:  Since Feb/March I am producing about triple the amount of energy I consume in a day.  I haven't hit the hotter days of summer with the AC, but my projections are favorable considering last year's power usage.  My AC was on 24/7 last year because I had a wife and newborn at home 24/7.  Now I can go back to an energy saving approach with us both working and her at daycare.\n\nEdit Edit:  Initial investment was nothing.  I went with a company that did two layers of financing.  One was a 1 year 0 down 0% interest.  Once I received my tax credits, the HELOC that I also opened will assume that loan for no penalities and I will pay them off at a much lower rate.",

I emailed the company and they confirmed: http://www.sorel.com/womens-tofino-organza-boot-1553971.html\nI'm waiting on buying them because they don't have a super long return policy and I want to see if any reviews come out first. Luckily it's still mild in NY, but who knows for how long. I don't love that the color is light, but it might be the only legit winter boot option. I used to wear secondhand Bean Boots, but I'm trying to phase out even used leather goods out of my wardrobe as money permits.",

Then I can prep some beans at the same time as the grain or use canned beans when meal time rolls around, add veggies of your choosing and sauce if you like, instant meal. I'm frequently too hungry to bother making a sauce, but I've found that if all of the individual components are seasoned well I don't feel like I'm missing out. Curry is also very simple to make if you keep curry paste and coconut milk on hand. Be sure to double check the ingredients in the curry paste for non vegan ingredients. \n\nMy go to preparation for veggies is to steam them then squeeze a bit of lemon and add some Spike (Salt free seasoning or Hot'n Spicy). Roasted veggies with a bit of olive oil and balsamic or pure maple syrup are great when the weather is cooler. \n\nGood luck!",

They were actually a success, reducing water heating bills by 75%.  A random White House roof repair in 1986 required the temporary removal of the panels.  Then they just randomly didn't replace them.\n\nI don't think it was a big Republican conspiracy, just nobody was paying attention to renewables at that moment and it was most likely an extra cost.  Just lost in the shuffle somewhere, not a huge presidential decree.\n\nIn fact, in 2003 under a Republican president, the solar water heaters were re-installed.  Of note, the solar water heaters helped heat the presidential pool, LOL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_swimming_pool",

While in custody my vegan diet was catered for and was given a vegan lasagna, I wasn't given a choice at the time but I've heard from other activists that police stations in the UK usually have three vegan options, lasagna, chilli and all day breakfast. They don't usually have plant milks, I drank some black tea and water throughout the night. \n\nI also know some vegan Just Stop Oil activists that were remanded in prison for a month and they said at first it was difficult as they requested vegan meals when they were taken in but it took some time them to arrive at the prison but once it was available they were catered for.",

It might do a bit better vs. a Model Y than the Mustang does, but it's still not there spec-wise.  Shorter range, smaller vehicle, fewer seats, not nearly as quick, comparatively primitive UI, minimal driver assistance features[1]...  It wins on peak charging rate[2] though, which isn't nothing.  For the right price it's no doubt a great car.  But no one seriously looking at a Model Y is going to be tempted by this thing, be real.\n\nIt seems like every few weeks there's another review of a \"Tesla Killer\" for people to fawn over.  And every time, I dig through the details doing the same comparisons that led me to choose my car last spring.  And every time, it comes up short.  The auto industry is maybe catching up.  They aren't there yet, and this generation of cars isn't going to get it done.  It just isn't.\n\nIf Hyundai or Ford or VW wants to beat Tesla they have to ship cars that **beat Tesla's cars** in something more than squishy subjectivity[3] tests.  Ship a car that's actually faster[4], or that actually drives farther, or is bigger, or has more capable autonomy.\n\nInstead all we get are cars like this, or the ID.4, or the Mach-E -- budget vehicles that look very reasonable in comparison when you take their price into consideration.  And even that would be fine, if they were managing to ship these in volume numbers that beat Tesla.  But they aren't, Tesla's winning on volume too.\n\n[1] The bit where he's demonstrating the \"walk alongside the car\" auto park feature is actually kinda embarassing.  Smart Summon was doing this kind of thing across whole car parks two years ago!\n\n[2] Or certainly should, once we see tests.\n\n[3] Ford's fake gas smell and piped in engine noise, I'm looking at you!\n\n[4] Porche got there for a few months before the Plaid shipped, so they get the Best Effort award.",

I can make it on a tank of gas, but even if I needed to refuel, I have countless places I can stop and be back on the road again in five minutes.\n\nWhere would I charge if I wanted to visit them? Would I have to wait for hours before I could continue? Now I know that there's a Tesla supercharging station in Binghamton that could top me off in under an hour, but a lot of people won't know about that. Even if they do, electric charging support just isn't close to the level of gas refueling yet.\n\nAs for me, the infrastructure just doesn't support me getting an electric car yet. As much as I want one, unless either my condo association or my work office install chargers in the parking lot, getting an electric vehicle would be far too much of a hassle.",

I thought winds were going to save us from extinction along with sunlight.  So you only like wind when it's conveniently spinning turbines, but not when it's fanning flames, and only like sunlight when it's directed at solar panels, but not when it makes things hot.  Consistent philosophy right there...\n\nIt's hilarious that they are trying to turn a fire in suburbia caused by downed power lines into some kind of freak climate change story.  Guess what?  There will only be more power lines to start more fires in the future if they have their way.",

We're considering tapping the power of a nearby light pole.  The pres of my association (a contractor by trade, I believe) measured the amount of power drawn on that pole's line/circuit (forgive my electronics illiteracy) and found it to be minimal, especially since we've converted from the old gas bulbs to LEDs.  I'll email him for the exact numbers, but it was like .5 out of a potential 100 &lt;insert proper unit here&gt;.\n5.  10-15'.  We can assume the station will be located next to the pole, if that helps.\n6.  Depends on whether this is a one-off for my exclusive use or an amenity for the condo, I suppose.  I've made it clear I'll settle for a regular 110 outlet tapped off the power pole (i.e. level 1 charging).  Just spitballing though, I'd say &lt; $2000.  That's not a hard limit, though.\n7.  I'm on the board of the condo, and have talked it over with the other members.  I have the green light.\n\nThese questions definitely aren't overwhelming!  They are exactly what I need to arrive at a solution.  A pedestal would fit the \"condo amenity\" use, but just an outlet would suffice if I had a portable charging station.  Level 2 would be optimal, but I'll settle for level 1 if need be.\n\nI'll check out the links you provided.  Thanks!",

I could see online he wrote the same correction to all 4 solar arrays he inspected yesterday.\nI sent a message to the head of the inspection dept asking for clarification and stated the line and load requirement to not be reversible.   She said she would look into it today and get back to me.\nI told her it is frustrating to get a correction unless they have reason to believe there is a violation of code.  They could write the same correction on every item we install.  Verify switch is suitable to operate light, verify outlet is suitable to have washing machine plugged into it.  I shouldn't have to do reseach for them unless they really think there is a violation of code.",

The cost of doing nothing worldwide is of course in the long run more expensive. But I never advocated doing nothing. \n\nThe Dutch are responsible for 0.35% of CO2 emissions. Other countries are as of yet not ensuring cooperations. This could result in us spending a lot on mitigation with windmills and solar panels (each with downsides) and then **still** having to pay for adaptation.\n\nIf it would be either or you’d be right.

Virtually all residential solar in cities will be such that the power you generate goes to the grid, and the power you use comes from the grid. In other words, you're not 'going solar', you're using exactly the same energy as before from the grid.\n\nYou know that most cities have Net metering.   With Net metering, the power you produce gets used locally, with EXCESS power going to the grid.   \nYou described a dual metering system which is pretty rare and will never work with battery systems.",

(check out the UN's livestock's long shadow to read about the livestock sector and their impact on climate change.. more CO2 is made by livestock than all of transportation combined. thats not even factoring in the amount of rainforest torn down to make room for farming [increasing erosion] and the extreme amount of fresh water and food we use to feed our livestock which would go much further if just given to us directly).\n\nthat doesnt answer your question tho, because you're talking about wild animals. and heres why i went vegan in the first place.. health implications. if you look at the diet in north america/western diets, you'll easily be able to see why the #1 killer here is what it is. heart attacks, heart disease, obesity, all these things are very closely tied with diet. people are clogging up their arteries, getting fat, and dying early because of meat, red meat being the worst. since i hate fat people, i vowed to myself never to be fat in my life, and the biggest cause of fatties is our poor diet.\n\nTLDR; i will never eat meat again, because i hate fatties.",

        "comment": "&gt;What's your proposal, ditch cars all together?\n\nDid I say that?  The topic is about the F-150 Lightning, which uses a 125-175 kWh battery pack.  2-3x larger than a more reasonable EV sedan.  It's not the car we should consider being the best choice for the masses.  It should be considered the vehicle that fulfils a need for those that absolutely need a truck.\n\nI could certainly argue that we all drive our cars less, use public transit more, push for 4-day work weeks, work from home more often, etc... as being a more reasonable and faster solution for reducing emissions... but... that isn't what I was arguing in this specific post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;EVs are miles better for the environment than ICE cars\n\nDid I claim they weren't? Nope.  I believe I said, *\"This is our chance to improve decisions rather than continue to promote environmental atrocities\".*\n\nSeems someone is jumping to conclusions.\n\nThe atrocity would be buying needlessly excessive vehicles.  If a person can get away with a car that has a 50 kWh battery, 250 miles of range, over 4 miles/kWh efficiency, and has no need for a truck...  is it a great idea for a huge chunk of those people to rush out and buy the F-150 Lightning with a battery that's over 3x larger?  Do you consider that the best thing we can do for the environment?\n\nI get that EV fans aren't always environmentalists and can clearly be selfish and greedy.  Clearly I found the hornets nest. ;)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;developments in solid-state tech will reduce the need for cobalt and make electric cars more sustainable to build in the long-run\n\nAnd when that day comes, my opinion will change.  The F-150 Lightning is not currently using SSB cells.  Nor is Cobalt the only problematic metal to mine.  You've clearly never done any research into how environmentally damaging all mining is.  Nickel is also toxic.  Iron mines have been responsible for wiping out huge swaths of land and killing thousands of people.  Aluminum ore processing takes a massive amount of energy.  Copper isn't great either.  Rare Earth Metal mining is terrible for the environment.  All mining is bad.\n\nAll of the above can create toxic dust, pollute ground water, kill forests, run off toxic metals into the oceans where it kills fish and plant life, including Coral reef.\n\nIf we can reduce the amount of metals we're mining, then we should reduce the amount of metals we're mining.  Period.  Full Stop.\n\nInstead people want to have a parade for a funking truck that triples the size of a reasonably size vehicle battery.  People who have never needed a truck in their lives are talking about rushing out to buy the one with the biggest battery.\n\nNevermind that these trucks only get 2 miles per kWh... so if they're using fossil fuel grid power, they're not doing a whole lot to reduce greenhouse gases.  What they will do is drive up electricity demand, meaning we need more power plants, whether it's fossil fuel based, renewable, hydro, etc.  None of those things are great for the environment either.  If we need more solar panels, maybe they'll come from China, where they could give two flying funks about the toxic waste panel production creates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Plus many owners use renewable energy to power their EVs. For example, my family only charges at home using solar energy. Educate yourself on the area before commenting, please.\n\nAnd will that rooftop solar be able to provide enough energy to charge a vehicle that requires twice as much energy per mile?   How about the home battery storage, will you need to buy a bigger system... aka more cells?  Will you sell less renewable energy back into the grid, thereby forcing the grid to find the energy elsewhere, maybe from a natural gas peaker plant?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe point is, we need to stop causing so much excessive damage to our planet when it can be avoided.  If we can get by with less, then we should.  Societal happiness is too often reliant on excessive materialism.   Maybe people should not only care about living within their own financial means, but the planets environmental means as well.  That comes down to billions of individual choices.  Congrats on pushing people to make the wrong choices... just because they can.",

The arguments I have had with them have been long and bitter(2,3). But the debate has now been brought to an end with the publication of the government’s table of tariffs: the rewards people will receive for installing different kinds of generators(4). The government wants everyone to get the same rate of return. So while the electricity you might generate from large wind turbines and hydro plants will earn you 4.5p per kilowatt hour, mini wind turbines get 34p, and solar panels get 41p. In other words, the government acknowledges that micro-wind and solar PV in the UK are between seven and nine times less cost-effective than the alternatives.\n&gt;\n&gt; It expects this scheme to save 7m tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2020(5). Assuming, generously, that the rate of installation keeps accelerating, this suggests a saving of around 20m tonnes of CO2 by 2030. The estimated price by then is £8.6bn(6). This means it’ll cost around £430 to save one tonne of carbon dioxide.\n\nMeanwhile the greens whined about tax breaks for shale gas. The government cut the tax rate from the 62-80% they charge on North Sea Oil to 30%. That's still above the 26% Corporation tax rate.",

That led towards the solar panels w/ Tesla Powerwall combo. Not sure if the Tesla Powerwall can combine with the solar there, which I think is what you're referring to. Again, haven't seen the videos and I definitely will. \n\nThanks.",

I mean, being cynical about our ability to change and saying \"I doubt we will\" is very much splitting hairs. I am certainly not saying we should stop trying, I have solar panels, permaculture gardens, rain collection, I don't eat beef anymore, but I still readily admit we're likely boned.\n\nObserving the discourse in our society, it's immensely difficult to see a path where people voluntarily make the right choice, and legislating the right choices will likely result in an intense backlash.\n\nThis single statement is so controversial in several of the \"environment\" subreddits, but I think it's perfectly reasonable statement to make. I think many of the people arguing that \"doomerism is the new denial\" are in denial themselves. Telling people to keep on consuming, buy that new car, cellphone, biodegradable straw, because things will be fine is way more irresponsible in my opinion. We need to change, dramatically, to save ourselves. Promoting more consumption is the exact opposite of what we should be doing.",

        "comment": "&gt; With my first comment I'm not doubting Audi's ability to market the car and sell it, rather i'm criticizing that they are not doing more than Tesla in range per price point nor are they pushing that range to econoboxes\n\nFair point, but I think I can speak to that, too.\n\n**Range to cost ratio:** We don't have a price point for the Model X yet.  The ballpark we've heard from Tesla is [5-10% more than the Model S](http://blogs.windsorstar.com/business/electric-tesla-model-x-to-compete-with-premium-suvs-minivans).  The range estimate is [about 12% lower than the equivalent Model S](http://my.teslamotors.com/it_IT/forum/forums/model-x-range).  So that's a base price of $90-95k, for 240 miles of range per charge.  My back of the envelope calculations [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/2ysinq/audi_confirms_2018_300_mile_ev_q6_suv/cpdt6fc) would theoretically allow for around 310 miles at $85-90k (assuming comparable efficiency).  Thus, the EV Q6 would be $290 per mile of range, compared to the Model X's #375 per mile of range.\n\n**Econoboxes:**  One thing that more established companies know is to not promise things before they can realistically be put into production.  If Tesla held to that, they would only now be announcing the Model X, and would not have said word one about the Model III.    \nTesla announced the Model X 3 years before they started *production.*   Audi announced their answer to it about 2-3 years before they expect to start *delivery.*  Based on that we're probably about 5 years away from an EV-A3, which would be the equivalent.  \nAnd lastly, you're not going to get \"Econoboxes\" out of Audi.  That'd be like asking Chrysler to announce an econobox.  No, Audi's EVQ6 is going to be the proving platform for the technology for the VW Group, which I expect will likely produce an EV Jetta with over 250 miles of range, around the $35-40k price point, by... 2020?",

        "comment": "I think the way to look at it is that the EV is SO MUCH better at stop and go traffic driving, that it just blows away ICE cars so bad that it's mind boggling. \n\nOut on the highway, when driving 70 mph, most of the benefits that EVs have over ICEs get reduced. You're not using much regen braking and you're not stopping so the fact that the car doesn't burn fuel when not moving doesn't factor in. \n\nAnother factor is that ICE cars have an efficiency sweet spot. The engine is more efficient at a certain RPM. Usually it's pretty high. Operating the car outside of that RPM range will be less efficient. Stop and go driving spends a lot of time outside that range, while highway driving will tend to stay around that optimal rev.",

        "comment": "&gt;Not uranium. That would last an estimated 200 years at current consumption levels (13% of world electricity generation). Significantly increase generation and you're down to decades.\n\nThat's actually something of a myth because it only accounts for land-based reserves of present pricing.  A process that was developed in Japan beginning in the 80s is able to extract uranium from sea water at roughly 2-3x present market prices.  The reserves from this process are several hundred years, even at increased usage.  Given that the price of fuel is such a small part of the cost of nuclear power, uranium availability isn't really too much of an issue.\n\nBut let's say for some reason that there aren't several hundred years of uranium and that for some reason that defies explanation, we can't get LFTRs to work (and we'll pretend that India isn't actually using thorium in solid fueled reactors today), if we can't get fusion going by then, we've got something really wrong with us as a species.\n\n&gt;...so why rely on it when we already have other options?\n\nThe only options we have that are generally cost competitive with nuclear are fossil fuels, but you are opposed to those as well.\n\nI'll state it again: renewables have distinct limits of grid integration.  To go beyond that requires very expensive, secondary storage systems.\n\n&gt;Don't be obtuse. \n\nI'm really not.  You have twice claimed that the only beneficiaries of fossil fuels are the 1% and that claim is patently false.\n\n&gt;I'm not saying energy didn't help, I'm obviously saying it doesn't matter how you make it, and there's no reason to say we will all go back to the dark ages as soon as we stop burning fossil fuels.\n\nNor have I claimed we'll go back to the dark ages.  What I really hope you will consider is the fact that making energy more expensive disproportionately hurts the poor, who pay a larger percentage of their income on energy than do wealthier people.  A proposal for low-carbon energy must not make energy more expensive.  If you think that can be done with renewables, great.  Please convince of that.  I know from personal experience that even if I had as many solar panels given to me for free, I *still* could not provide baseload power for a community because storage is still so damned expensive and looks to be for a very long time.\n\n&gt;Maybe they didn't grow up in Central Europe?\n\nIs this where your opposition of nuclear comes from?  Chernobyl?  If so, may I suggest, and I do this with genuine respect for the feelings of those who have lived near enough to the region to be legitimately afraid, that nuclear power is far safer today than the flawed design that resulted in that disaster?\n\n&gt;I have. \n\nForgive me, but you really haven't.  A discussion of subsidies in one part of the world is nowhere near as comprehensive as the study I cited.",

        "comment": "The core of the problem is that the energy you get from solar panels on water (with all the additional benefits of the system you’ve described) is more than what you get on return from burning hydrogen if you turn that energy into potential via electrolysis. De-oxygenation is a huge problem but if you’re taking water to do it, taking two molecules of water for every molecule of oxygen, you’re not improving the oxygenation of that system. So set up those panels just, don’t use it for water electrolysis. You lose way too much energy (that has to come from something that isn’t electrolysis for obvious reasons)\n\nThe math just doesn’t add up. Our solution to oxygenation is not to take away water and add oxygen (not a positive effect, this isn’t a magic hat), it needs to be a rapid reduction in acidification by immediately ending our fossil fuel production. Nuclear is the best option we have, right now today, to cut those emissions and keep shifting towards solar and wind while improving our energy efficiency. Obviously mining for nuclear has an impact but it’s the cleanest feasible option we have today. And we need to have started decades ago we all agree. \n\nYou bring up 9 great points that are truly a great system (#5 is very far away considering our current inefficient use of energy but I like it), it’s just that at its core, that energy can hit all those points without electrolysis but electrolysis only achieves a lower energy output. You still need more energy to separate water into 2H2 and O2 than you get out from it. Just use that energy for what it’s really intended instead of making a less efficient fuel\n\nYou’re a biology grad so you get my point from a a chemistry perspective. For anyone reading who doesn’t, basically burning hydrogen to make water gives you X energy. You can only capture X - y (where y is a non-zero and positive number) energy as no system is completely efficient. In order to separate hydrogen and oxygen from water takes X + z (where z is also a non-zero and positive number). Ultimately the energy you get from electrolysis will ALWAYS be less than the energy you start with. So yes let’s make solar farms on fresh and saltwater systems. Let’s tie it into the energy grid and store it somehow (neither electrolysis or batteries are currently up to this task but hopefully we get a breakthrough soon) while banning commercial fishing in some regions to allow for population rebound. Let’s just not waste that energy on electrolysis right?",

If Tesla can code an app to communicate with Tesla’s server and enable payment, they can certainly also code a payment stall to do that job.\n\nI don’t know why so many see this as an obstacle. It is a pretty minor task.\n\nFor comparison: Tesla retrofitted an additional CCS cable on their stalls. It took them 3 months to cover most of their supercharger stations in Europe. That was actually a physical modification of the stalls. \n\nA separate payment stall can be set up with no physical modifications at all. You just need a bit of power and network.",

It didn't make sense, because photovoltaics should mostly use the visible spectrum. (So the uv filtering in the glass shouldn't have a huge effect...) My best hypothesis was a combination of differing angles of refraction (between the windshield and the panel ) and the fact that the car frame cast shadows at different times of day. \n\nAnyway, you may want to try just getting a 50 and seeing how it goes. You may find that it's not very feasible even if you double the power. Or you may decide that 50 is plenty. \n\nLet us know what you go with and how it works out.",

Only the fact that the initial investment is so large and the payback so elongated that I have not. Having watched Princeton University replace large numbers of panels shortly after they were installed due to defects..my resolve to continue using wood and fossil fuels was reinforced.\n\nSure I could spend the money and when the manufacturer goes bankrupt i could spend it again. no thanks. And I would point out that while businesses or other organizations get financial subsidies..where i am located, the average home owner does not. when this whole alternative energy sourcing becomes competitive and reliable you will see it be implemented w/o the requirement for subsidies. btw did you know that the subsidies are high enough in Spain to allow those with solar panels to generate electricity from them at night?",

I’ve been doing that for the last 9 months (2017 Bolt, drive to work round trip ~50 miles, 4 days per week). And ESPECIALLY if you have a free charger at work, I’d call it a no-brainer. Ioniq5 may very well be the best choice out there, particularly the RWD, that 300 mile range should cover you for most the week, probably looking at 1 full fill up per week (to put it in perspective, that would equate to about 15k miles per year). \n\nYes there are days I wish I had a charger at home just for the sake of convenience, but especially with the FREE 30-min fill ups from EA, this is 100% doable. I’m looking at the EV6 myself, but that doesn’t come with free charging, I’m just not a fan of the Ioniq styling. \n\nYou got this!",

Here is a link to a local paper that warns about HERO. http://www.pe.com/articles/hero-758344-program-home.html\nI'm of the mind that the solar companies are inflating their cost to reflect the various rebates and incentives. In Riverside County using Sullivan Power gives the owner a $2000.00 rebate. The only other incentive for my city is the Federal Tax Credit. If there were no rebates would homeowners be unlikely to have it installed at the current cost? Without the rebates would the Solar Companies be forced to reduce their price?",

I think this is one of those cases where there might be a good product (with bad software) that might sink the company. Even if a company without the issues Fiskar has, delivers a great product, it doesn't mean they will survive. In today's marketing heavy society, the best products don't always win, especially if they start on the wrong foot. I doubt Fisker makes it another 5 years with big manufacturers catching up on EVs and lowering prices.",

This was in Williamson County using Perdenales Electrical Co-op, with a composite shingle, two-story house built in 2004.  Not sure if your house has an odd roof or needs updated electrical, but there are other things that might factor into the price.  The value of energy generation was forecast to be $71.04/year.  It would have taken me 13.6 years to pay it off, or about a 7.4% ROI.  That's not bad, and it doesn't factor in any increases in electrical rates.  If I invest this money and get a decent 6%, I would still have to pay capital gains taxes on that.\n\nAustin Energy has an [incentive program](http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/solar-solutions/solar-pv-systems/current-solar-incentive-levels/!ut/p/a1/jVFNb4MwDP0tPXCkMXRsaDdKqxb6wWEbY1ymrEtppJAgJzB1v35hTJ1UrVpzsGL7-fnJj5SkIKWkHa-o4UpS0efl7au3DG68KXhp-Bh4EMXpdh7kkzSZgQW8WAD4ob-MwU-yeTaDJM_yKFvFsIgnV85feBH8N59escDHTbypSNlQc3C53CtSaCUouk3n6qM2rNak2LWITBp36HC5swnvmCtYx4TuaSL5NgktDbI9Q4bjFu19DsY09w44QFttuGSSYXUc71TtwEejHWgUGipsm9k_qgppbavDEhvb_s6nwq8eB5Bp_t5roOJH08DtIjXsLzkHpQ0pzmWQZ1J-n-hk0eLODyFaxNNVkG-9aO6fA_7wcABcNqmpn4rP9VJ06_1DUo1GXwxFwcE!/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/), but you said your cost was after discount, so I'm not sure if this was factored in or not.  \n\n[Austin Energy](http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/solar-solutions/solar-pv-systems/residential-solar-energy-rate/!ut/p/a1/jVHLboMwEPyWHDgSL1Ba1JtDEI88OLSllEvltuYhgY1sQ5V-fU2Qoipt1PhgeXdndqwZVKAcFYyMTUVUwxlpp7q4fbUi98ZagZV4j64F2E_2gZs5SbwGDXjRALA9O_LBjtMgXUOcpRlONz6EvnMl_8LB8B8_uULAFjt_V6GiJ6o2G1ZylEveEmH2oykPUtFOolxQ2XxQphrSmvOUMiqqgymIotMWzN4cT28RtKSCiuUgtD21Uv29AQaQQaqGzZTlO-8M-OylAT0XirR6TPVb8EqQTnfn_foeJptPjZ_f-a1Xc6lQfq6DnlFxtOAUQXhne4BDf7Vxs72FA_sc8EdGM-ByCH33lH9to3bclg9xtVh8A1iBxGI!/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/) has an odd way of factoring your solar power credit.  Instead of measuring the sheer amount of electricity produced, they measure the value of that electricity, then knock it off your bill, up to the amount they would have charged you.  Any excess will roll over to the next month, but cannot be applies to other areas of your bill, such as water or trash.  Not sure if this can be applied to the \"customer charge\" portion, which is merely the privilege of being hooked up to the grid.\n\nIt seems pretty high if you are getting your quote after federal and AE incentives, about average if you are getting a quote prior to incentives being applied.  I hope this helps.\n\nThese were using 24 Green Triplex PM245P00 (240-260w) panels with a Solis-5K-2G-US inverter connected to a desktop CPU monitoring system.",

Also, Tesla isn't decimating anyone, even after burning through $60 billion of investor money after 17 years, they control around ~2% of the car market revenue and ~0% of the car market profits.\n\n-\n\n&gt;Ever stop to think that due to building factories and actually making a technologically superior product doesnt cost them a ton of money?\n\nTesla said (in 2019 IIRC?) that they need to spend $65bn in capex until 2030 to reach their stated goals. That is over $6bn per year. They are on track to maybe reach ~$2bn this year. Building factories costs a ton of money. They got lucky with the first three factories. California gave them the Fremont factory for basically $0, Panasonic and the state of Arizona spent a lot of money on the Arizona GF1 for Tesla and the state of New York gave Tesla GF3 for MINUS -$600 million (they gave them the GF3 and $600 million in subsidies on top of that), but will this keep happening forever?",

No doubt, the stock price boom and the chatter he hears in his rich people circles are all things that Trump wants to be associated with.  I'm not convinced Trump is pro-EV at all.  I'm just convinced he's a narcissist and this plays well into his overall narrative.",

I've sent off a question to our solar installer to ask about going all the way down to the SE7600 and their thoughts.\n\nIn my analysis of the PVWatts data, it would cause some more clipping - losing us about 3% of the output per year, but with the reduced costs that we should be able to see (simpler install into the main service panel rather than needing a line-side tap and the difference in the cost of the inverter itself) I'm seeing that it would be something like 15 years for that loss to outweigh the extra expense and complexity.\n\nVery interesting",

        "comment": "Hi all, would love to hear your thoughts between these three choices for my first EV/PHEV. \n\n  \n\\- Prius Prime (2023/2024 body style preferred)  \n\\- 2023 Chevy Bolt  \n\\- Mini Cooper SE  \n\n\nI am replacing a Honda Fit which I loved due to the awesome cargo space and fuel efficiency. I also loved that it could be parked anywhere due to its size. An aptly named car that I wish they were still producing here in the states. \n\n  \nLooking to take advantage of as many incentives as I can to get into a reasonably affordable EV/PHEV via lease, lease buyout hack, or finance. \n\n  \nMy driving habits/needs:  \n\\- Location: WI (four seasons with cold climate)  \n\\- Budget: $30,000 (with trying to take advantage of as many incentives as I can - lease vs. finance/tax credits/offers/Costco membership/etc) - I do not need a ton of bells and whistles. Apple CarPlay would be ideal, however.   \n\\- Estimated timeframe of purchase: 3 months  \n\\- Daily commute: 15 total miles (work fully remote; use the car solely for getting to the gym, visiting friends, Costco runs, and snowboarding)  \n\\- Avg weekly miles: 100 miles  \n\\- Longer commutes while rare, will happen (drive to Chicago, for example, is about 80-90 miles)  \n\\- Living situation: rent with garage storage. I have access to power, but will not be installing a Level 2 charger. My access to charging otherwise would be inconvenient.   \n\\- Cargo/Passenger needs: Single, no kids or pets. I will need cargo space for Costco hauls and snowboarding gear (I absolutely prefer hatchbacks, but do not want the size of an SUV)  \n\\- This will be my only vehicle\n\n  \nI am aware that these three vehicles are all vastly different in terms of EV range, and I see the pros and cons of each for the most part. I am hoping to see if any of you were deciding between the same vehicles and how you came to your decision and/or if you would still stay with the same decision. \n\n  \nWhere I live public transportation is garbage. Unfortunately, a need for a car to get groceries, errands, etc done is necessary.",

It’s been a great car and the reason I want to stay in the Tesla ecosystem and not jump to something like a BMW I4.\n\nI really like the new build quality of the model 3 but at the same time I wanted to get the Model S for the added features and comfort. I’d definitely get a used S as I can’t afford over 60k.\n\nI’m also thinking of waiting for Juniper since I’d prefer an SUV but concerned about losing the tax credit next year and also not sure how long I’ll wait sharing my wife’s car. I don’t have to get an SUV but would prefer for easier step in and maybe children coming in the next couple years.  \n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes?",

The awareness of environmental protection and the future of society has been increased by the pandemic.\n\n&gt; \"Our electric cars are sold out at the moment\", said Bagschik. With the VW e-up, there is almost a year's waiting period. \"It's not so much a demand problem as a supply problem,\" she said: \"We will expand capacities as much as possible and build what needs to be built.\n\nAlso some interesting data about ID.3 pre-bookers:\n\n&gt; Starting in September, VW will first deliver the ID.3 to customers who have pre-ordered it. 36,000 had ordered it, only 10 to 20 percent had cancelled. However, the number will be easily filled up by interested parties who have registered on waiting lists.",

If you follow the reference link for those figures, it leads to a XLS file, in German, from the German government.\n\nOpening the spreadsheet provides figures for 2011, and shows that the figures indicated on the WP page are slightly inaccurate, but more importantly not well labeled. The \"Others\" indicated is actually \"Other renewables, including Photovoltaics\".\n\nThe updated numbers look more like this:\n\n* Oil 34%\n* Coal 12.6%\n* Lignite 11.7 %\n* Natural gas 20.4%\n* Nuclear power 8.8%\n* Hydro and Wind Power 1.8%\n* Other renewables (incl. PVs) 9.1%\n* Foreign trade balance for electricity (not sure what that is) -0.1%\n* Others 1.7%\n\nFor a grand total of 100% (the WP table only totals 88.9%). \n\nGranted, it's incorrect to say that 20% of the electricity consumed in Germany is from renewables. However, 10.9% is a *significant* proportion of the total energy consumed, especially when you consider that the country is still in the early stages of its planned move towards renewables.",

All consumption obviously isn't equally unethical, so make sure to point this out and discuss the varying degrees of unethical consumption (animal agriculture being, by far, the worst of them). A lot of leftists focus most of their energy on tearing down the capitalist system first and foremost and thus don't feel it is pertinent to address any issues within the system before then. There is also a tendency to deify rationale/scientific thought in leftist spaces, which leads to them being unreceptive to moral arguments. I think it is important to align your morals with your beliefs and I dislike that so many leftists that want to put a stop to human exploitation fail/refuse to see the parallels with animal exploitation.",

Second the Volt batteries catching fire *was* completely overblown by the media. The final verdict is that the Volt is [no more at risk of fire](http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-57363756-54/chevy-volt-poses-no-elevated-fire-risk-nhtsa-says/) in an accident than any traditional ICE automobile. No EVs have caught fire in real-world conditions, but traditional car fires happen every day.\n\nI don't know what press you're talking about with regard to Tesla, but so far they're a boutique product catering to high-end customers, and being a completely new company it's no surprise they've had their share of difficulties.\n\nInteresting that you don't have any bad press to mention about the only example of a real mass-produced EV out on the market now, the Nissan Leaf.",

The collector on the roof runs through a heat exchanger in a hot water tank (with backup electric heat), and when the temperature in the tank is high enough a second pump circulates through the floor.\n\nIf I were to set up the system from scratch I would get rid of the second hot water tank and have a single dual-coil tank (still with electric backup) for domestic hot water. One coil would be for roof circulation, the other for floor circulation.\n\nIn general, the payoff for installing a thermal system like this is much quicker than the payoff for photovoltaics. That said, if you don't already have plumbing to the roof, and you have to worry about pipes freezing, I'd seriously consider maxing out a PV system and not do the thermal system.",

And further down the page that **global sea ice levels have remained constant since 1979**.\n\nThis week, after reviewing his own new data, NASA climate scientist Jay Zwally said: \"At this rate, the Arctic Ocean could be nearly **ice-free at the end of summer by 2012**, much faster than previous predictions.\" \n- [Article from 2007](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/12/071212-AP-arctic-melt.html)\n\nHmmm, problem with the data, maybe the models? Do you recall the impending Ice Age that was being touted in the 70's?\n\nConcerning the IPCC, they told us there would be [estimated that there would be between 50 million and 200 million environmental migrants by 2010.](http://www.un.org/press/en/2008/ga10725.doc.htm)\n\nStill waiting on that one. The point is that despite \"climate scientists\" asserting that what they are doing is \"science\", it's really just a politically motivated guess, and an extremely expensive one at that.\n\n[Freeman Dyson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiKfWdXXfIs) who is more scientist than 20 \"climate scientists\" is a skeptic. He's also immune to worrying about trivialities like funding for research, as he's retired. Makes you wonder how many \"climate scientists\" are hopping aboard the cash train that's driven by alarmists.\n\nChristopher Monckton did an [interesting calculation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agyjz9pZfB4) based on the flawed IPCC data that showed that if we wanted **to save 1 F degree from human caused warming, we would have to stop all global man made carbon emissions for 33 years**. And that's not touching the 800 lb gorilla in the room that is naturally emitted CO2.\n\nSo off you go then, cover your home in solar panels and take a bike to work knowing that you are doing absolutely nothing for the climate.",

        "comment": "If your employer is truly interesting in installing EVSEs at the office, let them know about the [Charge Ahead Colorado grant program](http://cleanairfleets.org/programs/charge-ahead-%20colorado) that will fund 80% of the cost of purchasing and installing L2 (240V) chargers or L3 (DCFC) chargers.  Also, Tesla has added [workplace charging to their Destination Charger](https://www.tesla.com/charging-partners#apply) program and they might help cover some of the cost to install Tesla HPWCs.\n\nI've owned a Tesla in Colorado for about 3 and a half years now and it's been great, I've done about 65,000 miles in that time and many road trips.  Tesla has really been the only EV that could conceivably leave the front range but with Electrify America opening more chargers, [including one in Frisco soon](https://www.plugshare.com/location/169440), and the long range of the Bolt it's not a bad alternative.  The new Model 3 Mid-range has an EPA range of 260 miles plus access to the Supercharger network but it's rear wheel drive whereas the Bolt is front wheel drive.  \n\nIf you're going into the mountains at all in inclement winter weather I would recommend getting snow tires as the torquiness of an EV, while fun in good conditions, can easily break traction on all seasons.  Also, EVs get significantly worse efficiency in the cold because they don't have a ton of spare waste heat like an ICE to heat the cabin or the battery, expect to see 50% additionally energy usage at times when it's especially cold or if the roads are wet/slushy as that will increase your rolling resistance, you might even see double your typical usage on short trips as they don't give the battery enough time to fully heat.\n\nIf you'd like to test drive a rear wheel drive Tesla please feel free to DM me, I'm on the SE side of Denver.  Also, there is a big [EV club in Colorado Springs](https://www.csevc.com/) that is fairly active, a [Denver Tesla Club](https://www.denverteslaclub.org/), and a new [Western Colorado EV Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1691902797561519/).",

I also have lights on my full-face helmet. \n\nWhy do I wear all that stuff? Because as a driver, I've seen how difficult it is to see cyclists because most don't wear anything. As a rider, I do everything in my power to be seen, blinking lights, reflective gear, reflectors on my scooter, etc. Even when a driver isn't distracted by their phone, passengers, or anything, it can be hard to see people on bikes or scooters. I look for riders in the bike lane, but most drivers aren't doing that.\n\nDrivers are conditioned to look for other cars and pedestrians (maybe). Anything to catch their attention to remind them that they are sharing the road with you should be worn. \n\nThe question you need to ask yourself is do you trust a driver to see you with the visibility gear you are wearing. Also, the hi-vis vest seems like a small price to pay to give your loved ones peace of mind.",

        "comment": "Whether or not you realize it, you're asking for a heavy subsidy. \n\nTo even swap kilowatts 1-to-1 is a subsidy, because it gives the panels free use of the distribution network, and doesn't include any reserves for maintenance or capital expansion -- not to mention profit, in the case of privately owned utilities.\n\nHere in Washington State, the utilities are required to go much further, paying 62 cents/kWh for electricity if the panels and inverters are made in the state. Their wholesale cost for that electricity is 3-5 cents/kWh, and the retail rate averages 8.5 cents an hour, which makes for a *very* heavy subsidy indeed.\n\nTOU rates are available in some places. In that case, they wind up being a kind of sleight-of-hand. The ratepayer \"subsidizes\" himself, cutting use during the day and using more at night. What you ask -- for the utility to pay retail high TOU rates for mid-day panel generation while collecting low TOU rates for night-time panel generation -- would be a gigantic subsidy. How gigantic would, of course, depend on the details.\n\nI'm a believer in both solar and EVs, and support *some* subsidies. I think 1:1 swaps are reasonable, i.e., a kilowatt for a kilowatt, but I wouldn't support going past that and forcing utilities to pay peak retail rates for power generated by panels. The farthest I'd go is forcing them to pay the higher of a kilowatt-for-kilowatt and the peak wholesale rate.\n\nPast that, you wind up subsidizing solar panels in places where they're simply not the best alternative. Germany has done this, and as a result their electricity rates are just astronomical. And the hilariously misleading statistical cherry picking that gets done aside, the results of solar power there have been miniscule at best. The claims for big results *always* fall apart on honest and rigorous examination.\n\nSolar power makes a whole lot of sense in sunny, southern latitudes. Make me emperor, and every rooftop in Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, San Diego, and the L.A. basin would have panels, and so would some pretty big stretches of the Mojave Desert. It makes all kinds of sense there. Same in parts of Texas and Florida. But heavy subsidies in places like Massachusetts and Washington State (even in the sunny areas east of the Cascades) simply do not cost out.\n\nAre we going to do this just to make ourselves feel good? Well, that's the local specialty in Seattle, where everyone falls all over themselves to *appear* virtuous. Or are we going to do this for real, and deploy limited resources in the smartest way? Are people serious, or just playing some sort of virtue-status game? At the horrible (ha ha!) risk of offending some of the innumerate dreamers here, I'm a realist. Show me the real numbers, not some faked-up fantasies, and then we talk.",

        "comment": "&gt;Oh, it's all irrelevant, yes? I thought so. It's only a MIT study, conducted by 13 experts from nuclear research and industry after all.\n\nAre you being obtuse on purpose, or is it just part of your personality?  I am pointing out that your quote mining was specific to solid fueled reactors.  Don't be mad at me for pointing out your lack of diligence, and please, please refrain from putting words in my mouth.  I already said I would look at the report more fully.  Perhaps there is something specific to liquid fuels in there that I missed.\n\n&gt;Your basic argument seems to boil down to \"Yes, but LFTRs\".\n\nIf you see it that way, it is only because you keep citing things that aren't relevant to liquid fueled reactors.\n\n&gt;So apparently, we're only talking about one specific technology for which a design hasn't even remotely been finalized and tested yet. \n\nPlease stop repeating things you know to be false.  Oak Ridge National Labs built two of these half a century ago.\n\n&gt;You will find that the study actually accommodates the possibility of molten salt reactors, for either an uranium or thorium cycle, so their conclusions stand despite your criticism.\n\nAs I said, I'll look at it.  I already pointed out that the authors specifically pointed out they didn't consider many thorium fuel cycles.\n\n&gt;If you'd cared to go back to the list of open LFTR design challenges I linked, \n\nWhat, your Wikipedia page?  The one that stated that most of the list doesn't apply to LFTRs?\n\n&gt;you will find that most of the problems above still apply for LFTRs\n\nNo.  As I've challenged you to do, look at the bottom of that section.  They noted that many of the things you call a disadvantage don't apply.  I would appreciate it if you would at least acknowledge what I have written.  Your source in this case refutes you.\n\n&gt;(except for maybe the high cost of thorium oxide production which I can't find any insightful material on). \n\nYou won't.  Thorium is incredibly cheap.\n\n&gt;In particular, the challenges do include significant proliferation risks,\n\nNo.  We've been over this.  The only weapons potential product from LFTR is U-233, and that is consumed in the process.  I will concede that if one tried really, really hard, one get get a poor weaponizable source of material.\n\n&gt;they do acknowledge higher risks to workers and health and safety,\n\nAs compared to what?  Certainly not present solid fueled light water reactor workers.  It is for damn sure less hazardous than solar power.\n\n&gt;they acknowledge challenges in the storage of liquid-salt waste, \n\nWhat waste is this?\n\n&gt;and long-term material challenges.\n\nThis again?  Please identify a single material challenge.\n\n&gt;So yes, maybe you could build a LFTR in 3 years but it will take you 20 years of testing to see whether your design is commercially feasible in the long run.\n\nBullshit.  You are just making this up.  \n\nI would hope you could admit by this point that you have been beaten pretty soundly on this topic.  Your assertions were nothing more than regurgitated talking points.  Your sources showed problems with solid-fueled reactors, but very few with liquid fueled reactors.  Your sources openly admitted such.  Now please go rethink your position on this.  As I've said, this is an important, life-saving, world-changing technology.  We need you.\n\n&gt;Let me point out again that I do welcome research into the thorium fuel cycle, and that I do think that nuclear power is a good idea in general, specifically to cover the base load during a transition to fully renewable energy. \n\nThe first half of your sentence held such promise.  Sadly, you showed yourself to be delusional with that last bit.\n\n&gt;But it's also very clear that thorium power in whichever form will still take a long time to, as the MIT experts put it, \"penetrate the market\".\n\nIt's only a matter of funding.  Had you watched the second video I linked to you would know that China intends to have LFTRs commercialized by the end of the decade.\n\n&gt;So I repeat my argument that it's silly to say we don't need renewables now because we might have large-scale thorium in the future.\n\nAgain, you are putting words in my mouth.  I am pro-renewables, especially solar.  I am very much opposed to thinking we can legislate around the laws of physics, and it pisses me right off that we can't get $100 million for a test reactor when we are funding the various Solyndras of the world.",

The author can't do anything by degrees, ever.  Either she's an aggressive and preachy \"vegangelical\" blogger, or she's an aggressive and preachy anti-vegan pro-meat blogger.\n\n3. The author will try to bend her ideology to support whatever it is she's doing.  That's why she pulled that feminist bullshit out of her ass.  She considers her ovaries a convenient shelter against ethical criticism.\n\n4. The author's problems are her own and have nothing to do with the rest of  us.  The vegan world is *not* in crisis because of this woman.  We are still eating vegetables over here.",

Those parts were there for vibration reasons and to hold up car production for something as meaningless as the print on a part the average person would not see seems pointless. \n\nStill in this case missing USB-PD is actually functionally different people should be able to refuse a car missing it if they want it now. I don't have wireless charging and USB-A and 12v would work fine so I don't care. This isn't like Tesla can go to the local electronics store and get the USB-PD part, so either take the car with what they can make or wait till they have all the parts.\n\nEdit: [I believe it was polystyrene](https://www.homedepot.com/p/TRIMFINITY-1-in-x-1-in-x-96-in-Polystyrene-Light-Oak-Outside-Corner-Moulding-85010/206822100), I just called it foam because I couldn't think of the material name I just had to look it up hours later..",

Their panels cost, on average, about 20 percent higher than standard poly or mono from companies like Trina, CSI, REC, Solarworld etc. Are they more efficient? Yes. Do they produce more energy and improve your ROI? Definitively no, they hurt it due to the increase in initial investment in system cost. I do agree they look good, but they are the worse investment\n\nSource: Work in the solar industry",

As it stands right now, they need the owner/operator of a project to bring tax equity to the table, an LTV of 50%m and they can't take advantage of the investment tax credit. So there are a lot of conditions they are looking for before you can involved with them. However, it also sounds they are just going through natural growing pains and they could very well be a great way to invest in solar projects or have your projects financed. To me, Feed In Tariffs and CCAs seem like a better way to go if the right conditions are in place. I'm still learning a lot about this stuff.",

And now that the company has folded, what those cars are worth now is clearly much less than they paid. By no means did those owners get a \"bargain\" - they got screwed. But I'm sure they'll be fine - they knew full well what they were getting themselves into.\n\nA new product and new company of any kind will incur significant startup costs that obviously won't be recouped until the product starts selling in sufficient volume. Sometimes that second part never happens and the product/company fails - that's how the market works and why investing in a new business is risky.\n\nNow, let's be honest here - is this really not obvious to you or are you just cherry picking numbers for sensationalism?\n\nOf course in this case there's the separate issue of where the money came from (i.e. the government) - but you can't conflate the two issues and have an honest conversation. The government made a bad investment in this case (obviously), and even more private capital was lost as well. But does that mean that investing in startup companies developing new technology is always a bad thing?\n\n&gt;gain zero benefit from them\n\nObviously the whole idea in promoting \"green\" technology is that *if* it succeeds it will benefit everybody, and especially the poor and middle classes. You can disagree about the merits of a particular technology all you like; and you can disagree about the significance of the problems such technologies are attempting to solve, but the simple fact is that a lot of people who know a lot more about each than either you or me agree that the problems we face *are* significant and promoting a technology like electric cars is one good way to address them.",

Solar panels would be a different matter given the cost and the benefit to the tenants but we'd be open to negotiation about paying some of the cost.",

You can drive your electric car to long-term parking at the airport, and take your two week honeymoon, without worrying it'll run out of juice sitting there from vampire drain. You can have an electric second car that sits in your driveway all winter while you drive an AWD truck, and not worry it'll brick itself running the battery heaters. A solar roof is never going to replace the need to charge the car to drive it, but it'll be plenty to keep it from *losing* power while sitting unused, so long as you leave it outside.",

My point was that the first world does import a fair bit of things from the third world and the reality behind them is not as black and white as the labels would like you to believe. \n\nMy discussions with most members in this group have been civil, I only stopped by because this post showed up on my popular feed, though I don't subscribe to this sub. However, if I were to draw some quick inferences from my time spent here, I would say that a fair number of vegans are from the first world and ignorant about third world on-ground realities. Hungry people have not had the luxury of time to contemplate their place in this world and make choices beyond the ones that take care of where their next meal comes from.",

        "comment": "&gt; It's not the 2 degrees average warming. It's the polar amplification of that warming which drastically warms the north pole and contributes to more significant warming in the high-latitudes and subsequently dramatic shifts in the global circulation, which would likely alter worldwide weather and climate, such as precipitation and monsoon patterns or mid-latitude storm tracks\r\n\r\nWhat does that even mean? Do you have a paper (as in one in a peer reviewed journal) to cite?\r\n\r\n&gt; For instance, sulfate aerosols are no longer a realistic possibility, because we now better understand their chemical interactions in the stratosphere. It turns out that due to processes such as coagulation, sulfate aerosols are only about a tenth as effective at mitigating warming as they were previously thought, because they end up being removed from the atmosphere far faster than we previously thought. This means that what was at one point a multi-billion dollar geo-engineering opportunity will now cost in the tens- to hundreds of billions of dollars to be feasible.\r\n\r\nOnce again - peer reviewed citation needed.\r\n\r\nI'm no scientist - I'm an engineer. And one thing you learn from engineering is that if you can't solve a problem one way you need to try others. \r\n\r\nThe chances of a net cut in CO2 across the planet is zero. You could cut it in the developed world but China and India will just pick up the slack and more. All you'll do is impose extra costs in the developed world via carbon taxes or emissions quotas but the amount of CO2 emitted globally won't drop. It didn't drop due to Kyoto and the chances of any sort of successor is now pretty much zero after the leak of the Climategate emails. Most people in the US and Europe see getting out of the current economic recession as far more important than trying to solve global warming.\r\n\r\nThe last I heard sulphate aerosols sounded pretty promising. They're not the only option either.  \r\n\r\nPeople like Freeman Dyson and Edward Teller have raised sulphate aerosols as a solution. [Paul Crutzen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_sulfate_aerosols_\\(geoengineering\\)) too.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society in the UK has published a report on geoengineering. You don't get much more consensus science than this.\r\n\r\nhttp://royalsociety.org/Geoengineering-the-climate/\r\n\r\nWe've got a test case for sulphates too \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pinatubo#Global_environmental_effects\r\n\r\n&gt; This very large stratospheric injection resulted in a reduction in the normal amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by roughly 10% (see figure). This led to a decrease in northern hemisphere average temperatures of 0.5–0.6 °C (0.9–1.1 °F), and a global fall of about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F).[17][18] At the same time, the temperature in the stratosphere rose to several degrees higher than normal, due to absorption of radiation by the aerosol. The stratospheric cloud from the eruption persisted in the atmosphere for three years after the eruption.\r\n\r\nI think you're not looking at this from an honest engineering perspective. You're trying to guide people to your preferred solution of CO2 cuts by talking up the scale of the problem and talking down other solutions. I think you're wasting your time quite frankly - the warmists have lost the argument on the seriousness of global warming, and also lost the argument on CO2 emissions cuts. Government might introduce a carbon tax but that will be to raise revenue. The chances of CO2 emissions being drastically cut is zero unless people build a lot more reactors. I'd say the chances of that are low. \r\n\r\nCO2 levels will keep going up until some new technology like fusion or very cheap solar panels causes everyone to switch over to that from gas and coal. That to me seems like decades away. If you're right about the seriousness of the problem - and I doubt it - it'll be geoengineering or bust.\r\n\r\nNever fear though - just because you or I can't invent a affordable geoengineering scheme chatting on the internet doesn't mean that it can't be done. Most geoengineering schemes I suspect could easily be done by the G8 countries. They have the scientists and the cash.\r\n\r\nWe are an advanced technological species - quite possibly the only one in the Universe. Mother Nature is our bitch.",

Wind is not constant, the sun doesn't shine at night, and battery storage technology is not there. They shut down nuclear and coal power, refuse to accept or soon will refuse to accept energy outside of the state created by fossil fuels. Plus they are purchasing energy outside of California at $1000 + a MW hour. There is nothing nefarious going on, just the woke environmentalist crowd getting what they deserve. California asked for this and this is what they get. No Sympathy whatsoever.",

And having a conversation about Veganism only works when people want to listen. Of course deep conversation can lead to conversion, but it also requires trust and respect. Both of which are non-existant at a car lot.\n\nThere has to be a level of respect involved in order for the conversation approach to work (close friends, spouses, family members). Otherwise converting to Veganism comes through self-education. Most often it is cause by watching an graphic documentary, stumblingly onto a thoughtfully written article, or seeing animal suffering first-hand. \n\nOne technique that seems to work for me is just not talking about my personal Veganism to anyone that hasn't known me / worked with me for a long time. To them I am just like everyone else. Then one day Veganism pops up in conversation and the message is brought to them from a normal guy that they already know and count on for reliable advice. That sort of relationship carries a lot of weight. \n\nOr you could just write a shitty blog post and try to get google ad revenue. Whatever floats your boat.",

As far as I understand the bees keep the temperature controlled within the hive as a protection from parasites and bacteria. Breaking this atmosphere leaves the bees either struggling to sustain it or fall for mite infections, which is a common cause for the death of commercial colonies. There are apparently trays that keep the disturbance minimal but those aren't widespread I think.\n\n* To harvest a specific kind of honey bee hives are kept in an environment with one specific plant in abundance which is unhealthy for the colony because they don't get all the nutrients they need due lack of varience. The supplemental sugar water is also a culprit in this regard.\n\n* It is oftentimes more profitable to let colonies die in the winter and instead replace them with a new one next season.\n\nThere is also the issue of queen wing clipping etc. but overall the honey industry might not look as grim from the outside but it still paints no pretty picture overall.",

        "comment": "&gt;It sounds like the issue is that he didn't know this feature existed because it's unlike how any other car on the road does it. In fact, didn't they add this button feature after the car was already produced, in that they didn't even consider this to be an issue during testing? (Or as I like to say, their lack of testing... since I don't believe they did much testing at all)\n\nI think you're confused. To perform a single wipe, you press the only button on the end of the left stalk. Long hold for wiper fluid + wipe. It has a label on the stalk to show you what it does. How could you drive the car regularly and never press the only button on the end of the stalk? If you're really confused you can just open the owner's manual on the giant screen and search 'wiper'. It's [on page 53](https://www.tesla.com/content/dam/tesla/Ownership/Own/Model%203%20Owners%20Manual.pdf).",

Pythagoras was a lacto-vegetarian and anti-wool, anti-leather, and anti-fur. Nikola Tesla was also a lacto-vegetarian. \n\nIf you read into their philosophies, they'd definitely be vegan if they were around today and fully aware of the way we treat animals. \n\nAs for famous fictional characters, you have all of the vulcans from Star Trek (Mr. Spock included), and Beast Boy from Teen Titans isn't 100% confirmed vegan, but it's very very likely.",

So if I were to use them for the install I'd miss out on the $9280.\n\nNot only that, here Tesla/SolarCity are so backed up on orders it would be months before I saw the powerwalls.",

If your friends/family are like mine, there are going to be a few that have never had a vegan meal and turn their nose up to it.  If they don't like it, they may never have another vegan meal again.  Try to just breathe and remember what the day is about.  Forget the negativity.  There's plenty of vegan food that will be satisifying even to the biggest of carnivores.",

I'm saying that we better attribution to cloud behavior, aerosols, and the ENSO.  We need to know more on what effect solar magnetic flux has on the climate.  Current theory says it has very little effect, since TSI changes so little, and the claims of cold weather during the Maunder Minimum are dismissed as old wives tales, or at best a regional weather coincidence.  \n\nNow we've got an interesting minimum coming up with a completely unpredicted departure from the projected warming trend.  Are the two linked?  I don't know, do you?  Does that not warrant study?\n\nOn the subject of \"we should have acted in the seventies,\" - fine. Act.  Do it now.  Put your money where your mouth is. Refuse to pay any electric company for power that uses any coal.  Tell them about it.  Make it public. Start a boycott.  Buy an electric car, but make sure the plant that made the car wasn't powered by coal.\n\nConservation efforts did start in the seventies.  Some of us took that message to heart and are living lower energy lives because of it.  Some of us are not.  When you say that I sat on my ass for 40 years, what exactly do you mean?  I spend my days telecommuting, because it's better for the environment.  I teach conservation to teenagers on weekends.  I live the life you preach to others.  This coming weekend, I'm leading a 50 mile bicycle trek for teenagers, where we will ride out and camp in the Paulding Forest, then ride back the next day.  It will be a very low impact weekend, and we'll observe strict \"leave no trace\" rules.  Two weekends ago, I hosted two boy scout troops and a Venture Crew on a campout.  I taught some pioneering skills, search and rescue, tomahawk throwing and how to make a highly efficient wood gasifier twig stove out of recycled tin cans.  My wife ran a fire-building competition for flint and steel type fire-starting skills.\n\nI'm certainly not the kind of guy who spends his weekends at NASCAR, drinking beer in front of a football game, or goes clubbing.  Just because I don't believe in the CO2 boogyman that's going to scour the earth clean of 95% of life in the next 150 years doesn't mean I'm wasteful or inactive.",

        "comment": "lol Did you even read those?\n\n&gt;\"Without the huge government subsidies for fossil fuels, wouldn’t they be eclipsed by renewables? The answer, for now, is no. So far renewables just can’t provide enough fuel and power to displace fossil fuels. The infrastructure to make and distribute them isn’t adequate, and many renewables have shortcomings that can make them difficult to work with–solar panels, for example, only generate electricity when the sun is out. If the fossil fuel subsidies disappear, gasoline and electricity prices will increase. That will help renewables compete, and increase in scale, but it will take years–likely decades–for them to reach levels high enough to replace all fossil fuels.\"\n\nSo why are you pretending like this is a done deal and happening right now?\n\nThe second one...\n\n&gt;\"Success this year was driven largely by the utility-scale segment, which was bolstered by a pipeline of projects initially hedging against the extension of the federal Investment Tax Credit.\"\n\nWhy does there need to be huge tax credits to motivate people to get something, if it's already succeeding under normal market practices?\n\nI can play the link game too...\n\nIvanpah Solar Plant Burning Gas... http://www.pe.com/2017/01/23/ivanpah-solar-plant-built-to-limit-greenhouse-gases-is-burning-more-natural-gas/\n\nIvanpah May be Forced to Shut Down... https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivanpah-solar-plant-may-be-forced-to-shut-down-1458170858\n\nIvanpah asks for bailout... http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/google-asks-bailout-federally-funded-solar-plant/\n\nIvanpah kills 6000 birds a year... http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-solar-bird-deaths-20160831-snap-story.html\n\nIf a single oil related facility killed 6000 birds a year, people would be losing their shit over it.\n\nYou're also comparing apples and oranges. Any subsidies there might be to fossil fuel, covers way more things than solar and wind does. All you're talking about with that is electricity. Fossil fuel covers that AND trucks, ships, planes... and way more. So why are you acting like it's all the same exact thing? There's tons of electric cars. Nobody buys them. What are you going to do, put a gun to people's head and force them to buy something they don't like? Or maybe you expect taxpayers to buy cars for people too?",

I'm not clear on if service dogs are suffering, but opposing factory farming is clearly much more worthy of my efforts, and tackling it won't directly harm my disabled friends. I think as the world gets more compassionate and more vegan and less ableist then alternatives to service animals will appear and we can support disability activists with those at the right time but now there are definitely bigger things to oppose when service dogs don't necessarily seem to be suffering.",

Coffee mug and french press instead of a keurig squirted in a paper cup? Things like that\n\nNext is influencing those around you. Don't be obnoxious, and try to appeal to the persons needs rather than preach. Frugal Aunt who doesn't care about the environment? \"Oh these cloth napkins save me $20 a month on paper towels!\" \"These solar panels save me $100 a month and the batteries keep my house powered when the lights go out\"\n\nAfter that move to policy. Maybe you get your church to install a free EV charging station, get your kid's school to compost food waste, or your place of work to reduce plastic packaging. Of course there's getting out there to vote, write your government representative or donate to an organization doing good work",

        "comment": "&gt;Is it really bad that we are producing eco friendly solutions? Like better gas mileage and solar energy? \n\nMaybe I  can address this a bit.  Please note that there are \"solutions\" that are ongoing and there are \"solutions\" that are proposed.  Solar energy falls into the former category.  Better fuel efficiency, surprisingly, falls into neither.\n\nI don't have any problem with better fuel efficiency, in fact I encourage it, but it isn't a means of reducing emissions once you understand [Jevon's Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox).  In a nutshell, efficiency improvements don't reduce use of a resource, but encourage greater use of it because the input is cheaper.\n\nI have two problems with public funding for solar energy.  First, it isn't a replacement for grid scale power in and of itself.  For solar power to really work, a secondary storage system, which costs at least twice as much as the solar system itself, is required.  Storage has been painfully slow to develop.  Flywheels, pumped hydro, compressed air, etc. are all *still* more expensive than batteries, and the cheapest batteries (for static applications) are *still* lead-acid batteries, a technology that is over 100 years old.\n\nSecondly, and in my opinion more important than the first problem, is the misallocation of capital problem.  By \"picking a winner\" in terms of wind and solar, federal funds have been allocated to projects with limited output potential instead of being used to produce proven, base-load, low-carbon nuclear power plants.  The funding level for renewables could have easily built several nuclear plants which could actually be reducing fossil fuel emissions in the long run, but won't happen now.  (I will note, to the Obama Administration's credit, they did approve a loan guarantee program for a few nuclear reactors.)\n\nThat brings me to the second category above: proposed \"solutions.\"  The things that have been done so far are fairly minor compared to what has been proposed.  It has been suggested that $50-200 Billion *per year* be taken from wealthy nations and given to poorer nations in the name of \"climate reparations.\"  Most people aren't aware of that.",

So yeah, your “silly little example” misfired there and I’m already questioning your beliefs.\n\nNot to mention I looked through your post history and yikes, you support the orange man.\n\nIf you want to know my personal baseline though, i believe that minorities of all kinds (race, sex, gender, sexual identity, etc) deserve the same rights as those that hold majority status (or in the case of sex where women tend to outnumber men, women deserve equal rights to men).\n\nIt’s also important to not be “colorblind” or any equivalent because with things like Affirmative Action, racial equality has only “really existed” for 50-60 years and still isn’t there yet, so we have these minorities that still don’t have the same opportunities as majorities and we need to keep that in consideration.\n\nI mean as a white woman statistically I benefited more from affirmative action than racial minorities, but I leave this discussion here considering we’re on a vegan subreddit.",

A fat known as a glyceride is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: a short glycerol backbone and fatty acids that each contain a long linear or branched chain of carbon (C) atoms. Along the chain, some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by double bonds (-C=C-). A double bond along the carbon chain can react with a pair of hydrogen atoms to change into a single -C-C- bond, with each H atom now bonded to one of the two C atoms.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Other chargers are more often than not, out of order, time restricted, more expensive, or any combination,not to mention the fact each station is owned by a different operator with each it's own rules, access cards and payment plans. \n\nI need to correct you on one point. They may not be called superchargers, and they may charge in 30 minutes - similar times to a Tesla supercharger - but that's because of relativity; the battery pack is less than half the size in most EVs, so even if charge times are similar to a Tesla, the actual rate of charge (in kilowatts) is much lower.",

I haven't noticed any change in my energy bills because I get all my electricity from 4 solar panels.\n\n Bet it wasn't [this stage](http://media.techworld.com/cmsdata/slideshow/3202576/slide13-rock-13_thumb555.jpg).\n\n&gt;The highly profitable business practices of energy companies have nothing to do with climate change. If you think you're paying too much for energy, then change your provider. If you still think you're paying too much, then think about how you can use less.\n\nThat's a bit disingenuous in the light of the fact that political measures such as the 'carbon tax' and 'cap and trade' are being proposed specifically in order to raise the costs of fossil fuels, and to make 'alternative energy' more competitive. But then, it seems that you have a vested interest in such measures:\n\n&gt;Actually, my business involves advising communities and other businesses how to be more sustainable, so from my perspective any moves to reduce emissions are good for business.\n\nEdit: \n\nForgot link again.

We also have a diversified offering, so we don't just help someone go solar, but we provide other options (spray foam insulation, window treatments, informed energy usage, etc.).\n\nAlso, I have recently transitioned from the nonprofit sector (after 15 years), and I have tried to figure out how to get nonprofits incentivized to go solar.  As these orgs are not eligible for the federal tax credit, it seems cost prohibitive for them to go solar.  And the bandwidth of these orgs inhibits them from successfully navigating the grant process (through NREL, or SunShot, etc).\n\nSo what is the best way to move the needle forward for these orgs that have fantastic roofs for (commercial) solar, but just don't know how to make the leap?",

I've spoken to perhaps a dozen business owners in the field of home energy audits and improvements, and every last one of them says their business would either be much smaller or nonexistent were it not for the utility incentives and/or state incentives that make reducing your energy losses more economical.\n\nA smart home that acts as a classical microgrid, allowing islanding and independent operation when needed, will probably sell to a segment. By definition this requires a degree of storage, that level depending on how long you want to be or need to be disconnected. \n\nSolar plus EV charging isn't novel and doesn't seem to be dependent on the exact nature of your power sources.\n\nAdditional security is a luxury item for most. \n\nSo, looking from the past and into today's market, anything beyond independent, local power generation + management will at best be a niche market. And the presentation features of energy management will help draw market, as people typically do want to know more about their energy habits and routines. But, so far, it hasn't been proven to be a motivating factor for adoption. As a side note, there is somewhat of an intersection where energy management and independent operation are needed together. But it is still a cost sensitive option.\n\nGive people a way to chop their monthly energy costs and be somewhat or fully independent of the grid and you will capture the largest market share.",

While in this class he came across a father and son who are both master electricians in South Carolina. They hit it off and decided to partner up. This information will be more important later in this post.\n\nNext, my CEO got his foot in the door with a local sales company who needed an installation subcontractor. We installed for them for a few years to keep money coming in untill we could get a sales team up and running.\n\nBack to the partnership with the electricians.\n\nI'm not sure how it is in other states or other countries for that matter but where I am, you need an electrical license and general contractors license to pull permits for any work you're going to be doing. Without this you cannot operate on the install side.\n\nAs far as sales go, I wish I had more advice for you but I really don't have anything solid. My company is an authorized SunPower dealer and we rely heavily on their marketing and lead generation to generate sales. This is definitely still new territory for us.\n\nDefinitely take the NABCEP course. This will give you a really idea of what you're getting yourself into.\n\nTalk to some local electricians to see if there's anyone who'd be interested in getting into solar.\n\nHope this helps you out.",

In evolution, the more diverse a population, be it species, or local ecosystem, the more survivors there will be.  \n\nHumans I think need to remember this.  Is solar power future proof?  No.  Is anything future proof?  How could it be, how could we know, if the future is unknown?  The solution lies not in finding one \"fool proof\" energy source but in developing several sustainable choices so that when unforeseen circumstances strike, there are always plans b, c, d.",

Those companies are all international, publicly held and profitable.\n\nI think span won’t innovate in circuit breakers but Eaton, Schneider snd Siemens might offer a smarter and safer breaker which might include switching. Span is just a (slightly) novel integration of a load panel and standard issue chips/relays, sensors, etc.  I don’t think it’s great tech or especially unique.  \n\nI could be wrong.  I’ll admit it when I reach that conclusion.  For now, I’d rather see the premium $ any given customer might allocate go to greater raw solar generating capacity first and to a well planned integration second. In my view, larger systems confer flexibility and give a solar project greater likelihood of longer term success.\n\nI’d also like to see more affluent tech savvy people retire working gas hot water heaters and furnaces which might be called a “discretionary premium choice”.  \n\nI think solar plus storage will be utterly redefined when v2g is fully unlocked so nobody knows nothing until then. Even 2 powerwalls is overkill if your vehicle’s storage is part of the system.  \n\nI have a sense of the market’s direction and my own hopes for it but absolutely no certainty regarding the final scheme for a smart home’s “hybrid energy system”. I’ll be surprised more than once as this unfolds. \n\nPlease let us know if you love the final built system and the span features specifically.",

So far renewables just can’t provide enough fuel and power to displace fossil fuels. The infrastructure to make and distribute them isn’t adequate, and many renewables have shortcomings that can make them difficult to work with–solar panels, for example, only generate electricity when the sun is out. If the fossil fuel subsidies disappear, gasoline and electricity prices will increase. That will help renewables compete, and increase in scale, but it will take years–likely decades–for them to reach levels high enough to replace all fossil fuels.\"\n\nSo why are you pretending like this is a done deal and happening right now?\n\nThe second one...\n\n&gt;\"Success this year was driven largely by the utility-scale segment, which was bolstered by a pipeline of projects initially hedging against the extension of the federal Investment Tax Credit.\"\n\nWhy does there need to be huge tax credits to motivate people to get something, if it's already succeeding under normal market practices?\n\nI can play the link game too...\n\nIvanpah Solar Plant Burning Gas... http://www.pe.com/2017/01/23/ivanpah-solar-plant-built-to-limit-greenhouse-gases-is-burning-more-natural-gas/\n\nIvanpah May be Forced to Shut Down... https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivanpah-solar-plant-may-be-forced-to-shut-down-1458170858\n\nIvanpah asks for bailout... http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/google-asks-bailout-federally-funded-solar-plant/\n\nIvanpah kills 6000 birds a year... http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-solar-bird-deaths-20160831-snap-story.html\n\nIf a single oil related facility killed 6000 birds a year, people would be losing their shit over it.\n\nYou're also comparing apples and oranges. Any subsidies there might be to fossil fuel, covers way more things than solar and wind does. All you're talking about with that is electricity. Fossil fuel covers that AND trucks, ships, planes... and way more. So why are you acting like it's all the same exact thing? There's tons of electric cars. Nobody buys them. What are you going to do, put a gun to people's head and force them to buy something they don't like? Or maybe you expect taxpayers to buy cars for people too?",

My two cents is that if you have three lengths of wire, 1) solar panels to charge controller, 2) charge controller to batteries, 3) batteries to load, then the length #1 is going to run at the highest voltage amongst the three choices. So that's the one that should have the longest run, because if the wires sizes are equal, it'll have the least amount of voltage drop.\n\nHere's my [Voltage drop calculator](http://solarloco.com/voltage-drop-calculator/)",

I've yet to get a membership card, or a special \"vegan\" discount on dinner, or even a friendly high five. I usually get shunned. \"Vegan\" is in the eye of the beholder. So here's what you do: you stop giving a shit what people call you, and do what you need to do. There are plenty of people who tell me I'm not vegan on here and I'm what people consider to be a \"strict\" vegan (if I know there's an animal product in it, I don't wear it or eat it). But FUCK IT. I'm doing what I'm doing. I can't change anyone's opinions about me. The only thing I can control is me. And I know I'm making a difference in my own special little snowflake way. And that's good enough for me. I certainly don't need the Internet's approval. I didn't become vegan for the Internet, or bloggers, or PETA. I did it for my own reasons, and that's good enough.",

I mean, what's one of the major gripes you read about on this sub all the time? \"I live in an apartment so I can't charge at home.\"\n\nWell, in my Minnesota town of 2,300 people the vast majority live in single family homes with at least off-street parking if not a garage. Absolutely no public charging stations are needed right in my small town even if nearly everybody got an EV tomorrow. The local electricians would be busy installing NEMA 14-50s in garages so maybe the change wouldn't exactly be overnight but still.\n\nOnce the used market for 200+ mile EVs starts to flesh out all these people living in small towns who commute to larger towns for work are going to be jumping at the chance to save gas money.",

Solar is going to continue to be installed in a beautifully decentralized way, all over the world, and most especially in the latitudes for which it’s ideal. I’m building a small solar plant on my business in Illinois, which us rural and seasonal and ideal for it. \n\nI’m saying that some aspects of civilization-like cities, and especially cities in latitudes unfavorable to solar, require more centralized solutions, coupled with sustainable solutions.\n\nThe nuclear industry is in the early stages of a revolution in development -partially motivated by the Ukraine war and partially motivated by the IT sector, and also by the petroleum business now, who are both about to start pouring billions into development. I was at cop28 this year for that exact purpose. \n\nI’m not shitting on solar. Maybe there’s a world where we can cover every rooftop in NYC with solar panels. In fact we probably should. I also think there will be novel ways to store that power in The pipeline for load following purposes.\n\nNeither of these solutions comes close to covering the energy costs of global transportation, however. All this tech will have to work together to build out a sustainable grid. Solar is not a one-size-fits-all solution.",

It sounds like this presentation is promoting a way of using microinverters that not only defeats the purpose of the microinverters, but does so to solve a problem that seems trivial if you have a decent charge controller. Otherwise I could be missing something. How does varying the solar array's power output to match the demand on the batteries provide a significant advantage over frequently \"topping off\" the batteries without variable power input?",

You can upgrade an SE7600 SolarEdge inverter to Storedge with the changing of the DC connection section.  If you want backup you would need a transformer as well.  There would be an additional emergency breaker panel and some electrical work as well.",

Substitute milk for plant milk and eggs for flax eggs, chia eggs, applesauce, banana, etc. There are vegan cheezes all over the place, vegan mayo, and even vegan meat if you're interested. Give each product its fair chance because I guarantee you, you will hate some that other people swear by, but you will find one you love. :)\n\n* PETA has a two-week meal plan: http://www.peta.org/living/food/two-week-vegan-meal-plan/\n* Colleen Patrick Goudreau has a 30-Day Vegan Challenge, but I believe you have to pay for it: http://www.joyfulvegan.com/vegan-challenge\n* The Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) has a 21-Day Kickstart: http://www.pcrm.org/kickstartHome/mealplan/week-1\n* A lot of Leanne Brown's Eat Good and Cheap, a low-income/SNAP cookbook, is adaptable to veganism: http://www.leannebrown.com/\n* When you want to treat yourself, a lot of OhSheGlows recipes are amazing, but most of the luxurious ones take some work: http://ohsheglows.com/\n* Post Punk Kitchen is the same, she has a lot of cooking-heavy-but-awesome stuff: http://www.theppk.com/",

Article is paywalled, but according to the Recurrent article https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/what-a-c-does-to-your-range posted above, the Mach-E only loses 1% at 90 degrees. The link from that article to  Tesla Real Range https://support.recurrentauto.com/en/what-is-real-range shows they get best range in summer and if you do calculations of best range in Sept (guessing 70 degree temps) v. June-Aug, there is only 1% average drop.\n\nIn Denver, we rarely get to 100+, but can get close to 30 90+ days. More concerning to me is winter range as that is when I do most of my long distance driving to the mountains for skiing. Denver typically gies down to 20 degrees in winter, while the mountain towns often are in the teens. Also concerning is Recurrent's statement that Teslas only average 60% of EPA under normal conditions, which means a Model Y AWD LR would only typically get 198 miles, but the Recurrent link https://www.recurrentauto.com/guides/ford-mustang-mach-e for the Mach-E says its 88 kWh battery averages 260 miles.",

In fact the reason I couldn't continue being vegan as a teenager was because I had parents who were telling everyone as though it was a Goth phase or something and people were getting defensive without me even prompting them.  All the jokes like \"How do you know if someone's vegan, AHAH don't worry they'll tell you!\" \n\nThis idea of the entitled, morally superior vegan is so ingrained in people that I have to wonder sometimes whether it has been an intentional effort on the part of the meat and dairy industries.  How PETA seem to make the cause look ridiculous and irrational, you'd think they were paid to specifically do that.  I don't think it's a coincidence that they give school kids free milk cartons with lunch etc.  \n\nAnyway whatever, I have resigned myself to eating meat while also knowing it's essentially evil and destructive.  On the plus side, I no longer cry about dogs chinese in wet markets because I'd feel like a hypocrite, so, I'm not.  Either all the animals are \"just animals\" or none of them are.",

The thing that affects prices for materials is supply.\n\nThere was no massive technological shift that allowed us to mine lithium more efficiently or wrap a battery cell more cost effectively. The reason the prices were so high was because the supply wasn't there.\n\nThe only thing that caused the prices to drop so a Model 3 could be affordable is industrialization of the manufacturer of the batteries and the supply of the materials. That's it. You can't have an affordable EV that goes 200+ miles without those prices coming down.\n\nIt was absolutely possible. It wasn't economical. That's when governments need to step in and put their foot on the gas to speed up adoption of certain technologies.",

        "comment": "It's more important to point out the average YTD sales.  Last year YTD, BEVs were outselling PHEVs.  This year, PHEVs are outselling BEVs by a pretty good margin.  Sure, there's a spike in June, which I imagine is caused by Tesla's end of quarter push.  Do BEVs fall back under PHEVs again this month, widening the gap?  I guess we'll see.\n\nGiven the overall battery cell supply constraints the industry is dealing with, we know it's possible to expand PHEV far quicker than BEVs with their comparably smaller battery packs.  In many cases, these PHEVs are also cheaper, meaning a larger demographic of buyers can afford to buy the increased supply.\n\nBEVs are often very solid cars, typically performing better than PHEVs.... and in offering buyers the choice between the two, people will often want the BEVs.  However, since BEV production is so limited, and with buyers willing to wait in line for the BEVs to become available or to come down in price, that's likely slowing down the adoption of PEVs overall, and is restraining the emissions reductions that would have come with faster adoption\n\nTake away the availability of BEVs from the picture, and now everyone who bought a BEV likely would have bought a PHEV instead, justifying PHEV production expansion that's only possible due to their lower cell requirements, increasing economies of scale, and helping push PHEV costs down faster, which with ample competition would lead to lower average PEV prices.",

No manual locks or storage? For workers this stuff is important and practical. \n\nThe 0-60 in 2.9s is meaningless when off-road, you'll just end up in a ditch.\n\nI think it speaks volumes that the invited press were predominantly YouTubers with conflicts of interest, i.e waiting for their roadsters and counting on people using their referral codes. Tesla has never been kind to any critical journalists.\n\nThis is a very different market to the model 3,S,X,Y which are aimed at urban/suburbanites. Those cars are much better thought out at the target audience.",

The manual for many EVs states that you should keep it plugged in when you can. \n\n> Keeping a lithium battery at 100% is very bad for it long term.\n\nMost batteries shouldn’t be charged to 100%, but some Tesla batteries are designed for it. However, EVs let you set a charge limit so that it stops charging ay 80% or wherever you set it at. Industry standard these days says that 70-80% charge is fine, even if it sits there for a while.",

Rooftop solar is only a competitor in so far as there is a rigged market to buy trivial amounts of home produced energy; if the solar homeowners had to compete with the utilities on a level playing field, and actually find a buyer and negotiate a price etc, they'd be stuffed. \n\nWalmart stores are very different; they are using solar to reduce their utility bill, and can use every watt they can produce, no exporting and buy back.

Try almond or soy milk, tofu for scrambles, and the myriad of vegan spreads for butter.\n\nMAny people swear buy nutritional yeast and TVP type foods; honestly?  Buy beans in bulk.  Every kind of bean.  Learn how to rehydrate them and cook them in foods.  There are so many delicious recipes for beans!  For a beginner, I'd suggest hummus (garbanzo), bean burgers (generally black bean) and soups (any, but white is the most common)\n\nTake a B-12 supplement; it's impossible to get anymore without eating meat.\n\nYou said you love dairy; you will have to realize that nobody, not Daiya, not nut cheeses, nothing comes close to real cheese.  The sooner you accept that, the easier off you will be.  Think of vegan cheese as a new product to try.\n\nEat vegetables!\n\nBreads are usually vegan; if they aren't, change out butter for oil and milk for soy/almond milk.  Look into vegetable breads such as banana or zucchini.\n\nBrowse /r/vegrecipes and /r/veganrecipes for a bit to get a basic idea of what to make.\n\nBest of luck to you!",

        "comment": "Well I have one question about this, being a vegan myself but also having had pet dogs in the past.\n\nPhysically and Genetically, dogs are carnivorous mammals who’s have the jaw and stomach/intestine to consume and excrete meat. \n\nAs hunting animals this is essentially what they would be doing in the wild.\n\nNow although we take their basic freedoms etc. When domesticating then as pets, should dogs not eat and be fed meat as that is what they are structurally equipped to be doing?\n\nThis is a counter point to the fact that we as humans have more in common with great apes like gorillas, as omnivorous and herbivorous mammals.\n\nThoughts?",

When I started to chew, my first thought wasn't \"this taste like chicken\", it was \"eww, this spring roll is off\", then realised after about 2 seconds what it was.\n\nThe same person also ordered the whole family a mussel pizza specifically for me. And \"saved me some salad\", which was actually just the bed of lettuce and celery that the chicken pieces had been resting on all day (ie, the leftover parts of a chicken platter which no-one would eat). Now _that_ tasted like chicken.",

        "comment": "First I came out as gay while attending a parochial university in the early 90s. That cost me just about every friendship I had. Then I came out as an Atheist and rationalist while we were around 3% of the population, not 30%. So coming out as a vega has been incredibly easy.\n\nHere are a few tips that have helped me and others over the years.\n\nIf you tell someone you're gay in a whisper, in the shadows with doubt and fear in your voice then that is very likely what will be echoed back to you in others. But if you behave as if its just about as unusual as being left handed with absolutely no shame or disdain then that is exactly how others will accept you with it. You are teaching other the correct response to being vegan. You show it in your actions and your words. \n\nBut, there are a few out spoken people who will push their preconceived notions when given the opportunity. Fortunately, there are very easy techniques to keep your courage up, disarm them and still keep the tension low. My fav for beginners is borrowed from assertiveness training. Its called fogging because no matter what the aggressor does to fog, they can never push or control it. It is very easy too. All you do is agree with them. Sounds counter intuitive but once you try it you'll see. For example, if someone says, \"Oh, Vegans are sick. You can't be healthy and eat like that!\" You could reply, \"I can see why you would feel that way.\" Or, \"Yeah, I'm dying right now. I'm so sick.\" Or, \"You're right! I can see how you know know a lot about health and nutrition from your super big gulp and super-sized burger and fries.\"\n\nIf this seems odd or awkward, practice it with a friend. Have them insult you in every way they can. Within minutes you'll find the key to never feel attacked from an insult ever again... In your entire life! \n\nNext, is you want people to ask questions or to express their doubt. That is the PERFECT learning opportunity. Those who most strongly disagree with often be the last to say anything. So, remember, questions are your friend. Teach them, dispel the myths and answer the questions. For many, the fact that they are asking questions means they trust you. If what they say is stated as cold hard \"facts\" then they don't. But even those people will often come around. \n\nSo, to them, do more fogging. Say something like,\n\n\"Yeah, there are a lot of odd beliefs about being Vegan.\"\n\"Yeah, eating just french fries can technically be Vegan and there are some people don't learn proper nutrition even when they are trying to be more healthy.\"\n\"I can see why you would say that.\"\n\"I'm sure your religion has lots to say about eating meat.\" \n\"You are right! I am '[repeat exactly word-for-word what they just said.\" \n\nIts best that after you do this just smile. Like there is a joke that you are getting but they are not. Its great to see the wheels churning. Those who catch on will stop and the rest will foolishly muddle on. But, once again, its never hard to get them engaged and to teach them.",

Do tell him that you want to be vegan, do tell him all the reasons why. Maybe it will work out like the religion thing did. Either way, it sounds like something you want to be a part of your life(veganism that is) so he needs to know what's going on. Tell him what you just told me, about how you feel like it takes him forever to validate your stance on this or that. Maybe he will respond to that. But, he might not understand how he makes you feel when you aren't really telling him how you feel about becoming vegan, either. You say he really upsets you, but you also aren't telling him fully what veganism is to you and you taste his foods. When people live in successful mixed households, it's because everyone communicates their dietary needs/desires/whathaveyous and both sides establish boundaries that they are comfortable with and willing to stay within. If he can't respect that and you don't feel comfortable telling him what you need, again I'd suggest therapy. Hell I'm not even married, nor do I live with my man but we've had many a session with a mediator, for stuff way more trivial than this lol!! It can really enlighten both sides on their behavior. Either way, I hope you can find a route to a place where the dietary situation isn't so stressful! PM me if you ever want to vent! I'm sure you guys can work through it! :) hugs!!",

Since I started posting the occasional information on my facebook about animals, ethics and morals I have seen friends become vegans, vegetarians and started promoting things even more than me. The sign that things are really working came today. My otherwise capitalistic, conservative and stuck in his way grandfather shared a call for animal welfare regarding cows, demanding they all be free range and the numbers cut down. My mind? Blown. Way more than I ever expected from him.",

If you don,t, it will be not that easy, but you have a lot of time searching for one.",

I eat pretty much the same thing Oatmeal for Breakfast, Green Smoothie for lunch, and Rice with bean and mixed veggies with sweet potato. Using all these ingredients I hit 90 &amp;#37; of my nutrition markers on Cronometer.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure where you live but if there is an Aldi's near you go there.",

Just because someone does not care about an issue(e.g. slavery), does not make it okay for the person to be a part of that issue (own slaves).\n2. If you don't agree with 1 and still does not care - okay, but all we(and animals) ask is, please stop hurting them and choose the vegan option whenever it's available(it's 2017, vegan alternatives are widespread). Whenever you go shopping and want to buy a milk, there is a soy, almond, rice, etc. alternative next to it. The same goes for cheese, chicken, turkey, beef, pork etc. .Please consider buying one of those, I'm sure you will like it.\nThis will have huge impact on reducing the torture of animals and a very positive impact on environment, that the next generations have to live in. Maybe you can find this motivating? I hope this is not much to ask.",

Considering the times we are living in, I believe we should all do our best to minimize our wastage. \nParoxysm is never good. You’re making everything seem either black or white, while there’s a pretty big gray area to consider. Lots of animal products don’t even look like animal products. I promise overall you’re having a smaller negative impact by wearing that pair of leather boots than by throwing them away asap and buying another pair of shoes. I promise your neighbor won’t think “Oh, I’m sure that isn’t vegan leather. I should get a pair of leather boots like these too.”",

        "comment": "If you're trying to adapt an omni recipe, a prepared cream cheese substitute is the way to go. I see Tofutti's non-dairy cream cheese at most major supermarkets. Simple; you won't need to adjust the recipe at all.\n\nIf you're into deserts, explore coconut and avocado. They won't necessarily work as a direct substitution in omni recipes, but—often combined with some simple starches—their fat content makes them very useful. I've seen nut- and dairy-free cheesecake recipes based on them, like [this](http://www.food.com/recipe/vegan-cheesecake-109114) [this](http://www.eatingbirdfood.com/2013/03/creamy-lime-and-avocado-tart-vegan-gluten-free/).\n\nSeeds will be useful to you. Tahini and sunflower seed butter, with their rich roasted flavour, can stand in for nut butters in many recipes. Hemp hearts have a mild nutty flavour and can be blended to a smooth purée that can be used for creamy sauces, as well as being a nutritional superfood. Flax is very useful as a binder, as well as having a great nutty flavour. Sunflower seeds can be roasted as a substitute for peanuts, as garnishes (say, for peanut-free pad thai) and in baked goods, and could even be blended for cheeselike purposes (though it won't tend to be as smooth, neutral-tasting, or bright as cashews and almonds do).",

Through a little experimenting, I've found it's even better if I make a quick little marinade of a few tsp of water with a squirt of mustard and liquid aminos/soy sauce, a few shakes of pepper, and simmer the deli slices in that liquid in a frying pan over high heat until most of the liquid evaporates, then let it get slightly brown in the pan. The added liquid makes it more moist, and the marinade adds more flavor to it. You can really use whatever you want to make a marinade, up to your flavor preferences. \n\nThere's also something about how plant proteins have a tendency to get stiff and dry under cold temperatures but readily soften up again with heat (e.g. stale bread getting nice and soft again when toasted) so if nothing else, try warming up your vegan deli slices before adding them to you sandwich and it will definitely make it more delicious!",

This being said, of course he went back, because it wasn't actually his choice, and now there's 2 things, either he never understood what veganism is about, or he does and still chooses not to be vegan. The first is understandable, because you basically imposed it and I doubt he even thought properly about it, he just went with it because he wanted to be with you, or if it's the second, that's bad and it's something worth considering, but if you ask me, that's something I can't handle long term and it's definitely a deal breaker because not being vegan entails something that goes absolutely against my preferences and values. That's not something I want in a partner that's supposed to be for life. But that's just me, I find it repulsive, if you don't, maybe you don't take veganism and what happens to animals so seriously, or at least to the point that you don't mind being around someone who partakes in the horrific treatment of non-human conscious animals, you should reflect on this asap and talk to him to figure things out.",

Many animal shelters that claim to do good, for example, sell the bodies of animals they euthanize to science facilities, as well as living ones for experimentation. I don’t really trust organizations unless they receive zero outside funding, and are 100% non profit. Corruption is a huge issue. Just like the USDA is often funded by factory farming. Their “humane” suggestions for slaughter are usually the most inexpensive for the company. Coincidence? I think not. Just as I’m sure an euthanizing technique other than blunt force trauma would be humane, but also more costly. I just think it’s funny you think these people give a shit about animal welfare. And saying it hasn’t done “jack shit” is ridiculous. Did you see the recent Washington Post article? Even media is telling people to go vegan not just for ethical purposes, but to save the environment. I hope you’re not a global warming denier...",

        "comment": "Very interesting article, I've never thought of the vegan split (which also exists on this subreddit) like that.\n\nI do have a fundamental objection to the article though. I'm somewhere between an utilitarian and an abolitionist vegan. In practice I am a pure vegan, like an abolitionist, but in philosophy I am utilitarian. And ultimately I think the author is wrong that the two camps do not have the same goal. Utilitarian vegans, like \"abolitionist\" vegans want to minimize the suffering of animals. Their goal is the same, the means by which they reach it is different. Utilitarians are more willing to adapt to the current state of society than abolitionist vegans. But they would be happiest if society moved towards what abolitionist vegans want. And they do just as much (I would argue often more) to further this goal than abolitionists. \n\nPersonally, I think utilitarians take a more rational approach to things. They realize that general society despises vegans, especially the more extreme variety. They also realize that living a vegan life by itself actually makes a very insignificant impact on the world. That said, I think the consistent philosophy, and the conviction to live within that philosophy, of pure veganism (an approach the author exclusively attaches to abolitionists) is the only way I can live my life.",

The thing that has stopped me making the jump is the long-term view. While it would obviously be great for me to minimise the harm I cause others, the logistics are what trouble me. I suppose the best case scenario is everyone becomes vegan and humanity stops exploiting other species. Yet the reality is so many of these species are now unable to survive in the wild and would become extinct once their use to humanity disappears. In my eyes, it is better for them to have a good life - enforced by strict regulations - whilst also increasing human utility, than for them to have no life at all. Can you explain your thoughts of this to me? (I don't mean to come across as confrontational in anyway, genuinely interested!)",

I have never witnessed anyone in my offline life ridicule or make fun of a vegan for being a vegan.  I think animals and animal life's are very important and would not pick on anyone who is trying to live a vegan life. So as for being picked on just for being vegan I think it's a stretch for actions that are out of the norm considering animals and your dietary choices being brought up in conversation where not needed I can agree vegans are picked on online from my experience online and offline.

You are missing taste and texture.  There are many vegan fake meats - and even better whole-food non processed meals that taste beyond amazing.  There are a literal asston of vegan cookbooks many of which have easy/quick recipes.  Mark Reinfeld has many that I recommend.  \n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/30-Minute-Vegans-Taste-Europe-Plant-Based/dp/0738214337/ref=sr_1_sc_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452888813&amp;sr=8-3-spell&amp;keywords=mark+renfeld+vegan\n\nAfter you are vegan for a while - the thought of eating animal flesh will be repulsive.  My ex in-laws - fuck me - would cook pot roast - stink up their whole house (not my house of course) and I would literally gag - and need to leave.  \n\nIf you are vegan for compassion reasons the likelihood of staying vegan for your whole life are better than being vegan for 'health' reasons - I believe this is true - I'm sure someone will let us all know how wrong I am shortly though :)",

Every other group is overweight on average. \n\n\nA plant-based diet may reverse type 2 diabetes. If your on medications to lower blood sugar or blood pressure, you want to make these healthy changes under medical supervision, otherwise your blood sugar or blood pressure may drop too low. \n\nMy reccommendation: \n\nCheck out nutritionfacts.org. watch the videos that are tagged with the conditions and concerns that are relevant to you (and the introductory video as well). \n\nI personally enjoy many of the recipes in the 'how not to die cookbook', and a lot of them are quite easy. I got a used copy online for like 11 dollars too. You may want to check it out. \n\n\nYou can do it both for your own well-being and the well-being of the animals. I wish you luck in doing so :-)",

I bet you if their local supermarket was completely vegan and they had to go out of their way to get non-vegan food barely anyone would be omni.\n\n\nI bet you quitters most of the time they say to themselves “I’m just going to treat myself and get <random non-vegan product> and that’s it” and it snowballs from there or just a simple “uhhh can’t be bothered anymore”.\n\n\nHaving a completely vegan supermarket would genuinely make a huge difference to me. I do live in the UK so it’s not too bad but still. At least that’s my thoughts on it.",

Feel free to PM me any questions you got, I'll give you my opinion :D  But it's best to ask a bunch of people because every vegan is different. IMO it's a good-better-best system. There are vegetarians, and there are healthy-vegetarians.. I mean, I've technically been vegetarian for the majority of my life, I went through my entire teens living off potato chips, mr noodles, and cocacola... Now I aint got no teeth :D \n\nedit: warning, taking dietary advice from someone without teeth is a calculated risk",

Even fruitarians eat many different foods. As in, they do not eat apples all day and nothing but apples, ever.\n\nVariation is also important because of vitamins, minerals and stuff. They are just not contained in every food, and not in every food in the amounts that we need.\n\nBut that does not mean anyone has to eat a particular *sort* of food. Just.. different foods. Even is a vegan would eat \"enough\" pasta all day, eating nothing else would not be healthy at all. \n\nSo of course, variation is important, and you need to get all amino acids, all vitamins and all minerals. But that's sort of a no-brainer.",

Indoctrinate the masses.\n\nI also used to work at a vegan and vegetarian restaurant (a smart way to meet your vegan comrades in the war against carnism,) where my coworkers slowly became my only friends. I also influenced two of my best friends to turn, and as a result they are still people I love. I have an actual friend group of about 6. No carnists except for my partner's little brother and his boyfriend who we will turn one day. That's just how it is. Why spend the time where you relax primarily with people who do not share the same moral base as you? I'd rather hang out with people I can actually relate to--who I can have frequent meaningful conversations with about something that is so quieted in this society that sometimes plagues us with anger about society in general? \n\nBut I am also literally the most preachy vegan on planet earth part-time outside of work (where I slip a little bit of this and that when possible.)",

        "comment": "I'm piggybacking but I'd like to add some stuff if that's okay. \n\nIf you go vegan I'd suggest focusing on whole foods as opposed to concentrating on a lot of the fake stuff. Beans and legumes, nuts and seeds; fruit and vegetables, and grains are the way to go. Just eat the processed stuff in moderation and you'll be okay. If you want to make sure that you're consuming around the same amount of calories as before (a lot of new vegans overestimate their calorie consumption) you could download https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ or https://cronometer.com/ to track your intake.\n\nAnd sometimes you might get cravings for things like cheese pizza. For a lot of people this happens because their bodies want some more salt and fat in their diet (maybe they used to eat a lot of junk food). So if this happens maybe try whipping up some vegan pizza with faux cheese or vegan cheesesteak.\n\nAnd there is no harm in politely declining non-vegan food offered to you. You have every right to say, no thanks. If you're concerned that you're going to be at a social event that won't have any vegan food just eat beforehand, or at least bring some snacks.\n\nDon't get too worked up if people give you crap for being vegan. For most people veganism seems weird or dangerous. Once they realize that you're committed, however, they (usually) stop badgering you.\n\nAnd if you're interested in meeting other veg*ns you should check out http://www.meetup.com/. You can search for nearby vegan and vegetarian groups (up to like 200 miles I think).\n\nAnd don't beat youself up if you slip up.

Might as well worship the product that you already have bought in the days before you were vegan so at least someone still benefits and the animal's life did not completely go to waste. That is of course unless wearing the boots makes you feel uncomfortable.  \nI don't think anyone will judge you. Back in the day when I was an omnivore I never paid close attention to what materials others' shoes were made of and I am still pretty bad at distinguishing real and false leather just by looking at them.",

        "comment": "&gt; starving to death with mere proteins\n\nIt's pretty interesting. I first heard about it from Les Stroud since I'm a fan of *Survivorman*. It's called [protein poisoning or \"rabbit starvation\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_poisoning). No matter how much lean meat you eat, you'll still need fat and/or carbs to survive. So actually maybe it's not that gluconeogenesis isn't efficient enough, but that you can't eat enough protein without getting sick.\n\nAnyway, the big thing for me as I get older, heh, is longevity. If you've heard of CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition), studies show that calorie restriction increases maximum lifespan and healthspan in all animals tested. Well, Luigi Fontana's work at Washington University showed that the underlying mechanism wasn't so much calorie restriction per se, but less protein, and especially methionine. Fortunately, on a vegan diet we are getting a lower proportion of methionine than meat eaters just by eating vegan.\n\nAnother thing is that it encourages calcium loss and isn't super good for your kidneys, although I suppose they only have to last so long. It's true that most of the bad effects are due to animal protein: https://nutritionfacts.org/?s=protein but I'm suspicious of too high protein intakes in general. If I didn't have exercise goals, I would eat lower protein than I do. It's just a sacrifice I'm willing to make, while I still can.\n\nThose Okinawan centenarians ate a 9% protein diet ;) \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4916345/\n\nThat's another reason that I would say that protein turnover is *not* a good thing, and adaptation to a lower protein diet is.",

So yeah, your “silly little example” misfired there and I’m already questioning your beliefs.\n\nNot to mention I looked through your post history and yikes, you support the orange man.\n\nIf you want to know my personal baseline though, i believe that minorities of all kinds (race, sex, gender, sexual identity, etc) deserve the same rights as those that hold majority status (or in the case of sex where women tend to outnumber men, women deserve equal rights to men).\n\nIt’s also important to not be “colorblind” or any equivalent because with things like Affirmative Action, racial equality has only “really existed” for 50-60 years and still isn’t there yet, so we have these minorities that still don’t have the same opportunities as majorities and we need to keep that in consideration.\n\nI mean as a white woman statistically I benefited more from affirmative action than racial minorities, but I leave this discussion here considering we’re on a vegan subreddit.",

They were using veganism to do things like mask their eating disorder,  lose weight quickly or cure some health issue.\n\nWhen I became a vegan people always asked 'do you feel better', I said 'I certainly don't feel worse'. Why did they expect me to feel amazingly better? I eat loads of junk food but six years later I definitely think I feel better overall (non vegans seem to have high levels of constipation and general lethargy lol\n\nEdit: I remember seeing interviews with Miley Cyrus who said being vegan give her brain food and Amanda Seyfried saying she was always hungry when being a vegan and I wanted to smack them. Motherf*ckers were simply starving themselves to stay Hollywood thin.\n\nEdit2:there's an ex vegan lurking in here giving down votes 🤣",

Avoiding rocking the boat basically boils down to asking nicely and behaving like good little boys and girls.\n\n&gt; I'm not saying certain tactics don't work, it's just that the same people could do a lot of good by not doing crap like this. It would serve to normalize veganism to the public which would, eventually with other methods, liberate animals.\n\nBut why should the onus be on vegans to try and fit into an abusive culture? I don't want meat eaters to think veganism is a viable option they might one day look into. I want them to stop eating animals.\n\nI think sometimes you have to flip a table or two when there is a principle at stake. I don't care if \"normal\" people think I am a \"freak\".

The only difference is I use double the amount of beans that she calls for in chickpea flour.",

I'm a vegan bot.  \n\n\n-------------\n\n**Your Fallacy:**\n\n&gt;Being vegan cares more about farm animals that sorry but have been raised for millen **(ie: Our traditions allow or require eating meat)**\n\n\n\n**Response:**\n\nIt is easy to confuse culture and tradition with ethics, but these are all separate things, and it is important to understand them as such. There was a time when the keeping of slaves was culturally acceptable, but even so, it was not ethical. In some parts of the world, female genital mutilation is a traditional non-medical procedure, but it is not an ethical one. These are only two of many reasons why it is problematic to equate cultural and traditional practices with ethical behaviors.\nKeep in mind that the purpose of cultures and traditions is not to eat specific foods or engage in specific activities. Rather, it is to strengthen family and community ties. This means that it is possible to participate in these things without compromising an ethic of compassion for all beings. Alternate foods might be prepared, and alternate activities might be engaged that permit you to stand your ground ethically, which might even help to encourage more compassionate cultural practices and traditions among your family and community. If you no longer want to participate in the slaughter of sentient beings, you have the power to make that change. You are your own person, and you are not required to follow cultural practices and traditions that contradict your ethics.)\n\n[Bot version 1.2.1.8]",

I am an overweight 45 year old dad. \n\nThere were many \"but... what do I eat instead\" conversations I had with myself. \n\nOnce I learned to stop replacing meat and cheese and enjoy plants for what they are the world took off. \n\nThe vegan world is so much more diverse in terms of flavor profiles. \n\nYou are a meat eater... your dinner tastes like meat salt... boiled veg. Butter. \n\nHit a restaurant and its butter on carbs on salt. \n\nBut you eat vegan... and you get sweet, sour, crisp, soft, salty, fresh... its all there. So many bright flavors. \n\nAfter 2 months of being mostly vegan I stopped reaching for feta cheese. I am actively craving hummus on cucumber without the bread without the chips without the junk. \n\nYour food nourishes you and makes you feel good in a way I didn't know was possible for 40 years.",

But as time passes and animal agriculture becomes archaic, the developing world will catch on too. Also, presently, it would be wrong for us to force a diet on to those in poverty like in the third world.

I just kinda wish that every person that continues to eat animal products were required to spend 1 day on a factory farm and see what your food goes through to get to you, if after that you could still eat it then by all means continue but me personally i couldn't. My cuban family every holiday goes to a farm picks out a pig, kill it themselves, butcher, cut down the middle and roast it whole on a metal grill in the ground to smoke it. While it's fucking barbaric to me i know there is no arguing with people who don't feel anything after that, different values, different folks. From another point of view a big reason for me going vegan was because my 30 year old SO was put on cholesterol meds even after cutting off red meat and pork from his diet, he was an egg and cheese FANATIC. I didn't want animal products slowly killing the love of my life from the inside so we made the change. Not to mention how we have raped and ravaged our plant for the sake of taste buds even when we have perfectly viable tasty alternatives. Some vegans are just real passionate and want to see a change in the world and others, that's all no need to take it personally.",

Because once you expose yourself to the facts of the meat and dairy industry, you will start understanding. I would start with this video and try to watch it with an open mind. This woman does a great job creating a good balance between bringing in both factual information, and emotions.",

You can argue back and forth about the relative health of the diet, but the FACT is there are lots of cats fed vegan diets, and they live for a long time apparently without major health issues. Whether they are unhealthier or healthier than cats fed an organic meat diet is hard to prove without scientific studies that just don't exist in great numbers. \n\nIs it a good idea to feed your cat a vegan diet? I don't know for sure, there are definitely a lot of issues to consider, and you should do your own research and always consult an veterinarian. \n\nActual scientific research on vegan/vegetarian dogs and cats can be found here : http://www.vegepets.info/diets/summary.html",

The biggest issue, though, is batch inconsistency. From crop to crop, and from batch to batch, almonds are rarely the same. So it's hard to predict the milk. The best non-dairy cappuccinos I've had have been with almond milk. But I've also had some that are very bitter and lacking in sweetness. There's a cool place in LA called G&amp;B that makes their own almond milk in-house. I haven't been there, but even a non-vegan friend says it's incredible.\n\nSide note: the issue with soy is that it curdles when in contact with the acidity in coffee. Not tasty.",

I’d send homemade vegan rice krispy treats for their class, all kinds of desserts, and then those little fuckers would never have a chance to tell my kid they were missing out on anything.",

It just gets tiresome to hear the same old jokes all the time, about the same thing day after day. It doesn't bother me when someone shoves bacon in my face and says \"HEY MISTER VEGAN DONTCHA WANT SOME BACON OH WAIT HAHAHAHAHA\", but wouldn't you think the novelty of doing this would wear off over time? It reminds me of people who purposely go up to smokers and start coughing loudly. Not bullying, just obnoxious.\n\nI don't feel intimidated into hiding it at all. I don't go around advertising it, but if I am asked about it I will happily talk about it. Many people actually are genuinely interested, especially once I mention the fact that I don't believe veganism is for everyone.",

        "comment": "Hello!  If you're not into cooking, a vegan Mediterranean-style mezze platter is one of the easiest ways to make a really impressive looking meal that's also very flexible for different situations (it can be very cheap or very expensive, a little food or a lot), and much easier to do than it looks.  You can often find the components in grocery stores now, and if not you can choose as many or as few of them to make from scratch (and you only need one or two dips, surrounded by a variety of fresh ingredients).  If you get them from grocery stores, just be sure to check the ingredients lists for animal products before purchasing.  You can find ideas by just looking at [pictures](https://www.google.com/search?q=vegan+mediterranean+mezze&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X) of them, or here are some: \n\n* Hummus (any flavor: lemon, garlic, onion, artichoke, red pepper, etc)\n* Baba ganoush (\"eggplant dip\")\n* muhammara \n* Tzatziki/Haydari, etc., using a vegan yogurt (although this may be harder to keep fresh)\n* Pita bread \n* cut vegetables (carrots, cucumbers, celery, bell peppers, etc.)\n* bite sized vegetables (olives, cherry tomatoes) \n* Stuffed grape leaves\n* Baked or fried falafel \n* Garnish with lemon wedges or lemon juice, fresh herbs, olive oil, or salt and pepper\n* bite size or cut fruit for dessert (grapes, berries, sliced oranges, peaches, etc.)\n* Don't forget something to drink \n\nMany of these are easy to store and transport in little containers.  Again, you can use as many or as few as you want.  You can assemble it spread out over a large dish or a few small ones in front of her when you sit down to eat, and it's very romantic.  Because it's all finger food, you won't need to bring too many extra personal dishes and silverware but you can if you want.  \n\n-------\n\nIf you would rather make things completely ahead of time, here are some ideas for that (from simple to complex): \n\n* https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/recipes/2016/06/28/4-easy-vegan-picnic-recipes/\n* https://www.emilieeats.com/10-vegan-lunch-bowls-easy-pack/\n* vegan [tuna salad or pulled pork wraps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Pvxh-4txw)\n* vegan sushi (many recipes at different levels of complexity are easy to find online).  Sushi can take a bit of practice to get good at making, but the recipes themselves are often simpler than you'd think.  \n* https://www.hotforfoodblog.com/recipes/2019/08/07/vegan-muffaletta/",

The article said:\n\n>In an experiment involving more than 7,300 participants, people were far more likely to choose the meat and dairy-free option if it wasn't referred to as vegan.  \n'Plant-based' labels didn't fare much better. Food with this label was chosen 27 percent of the time, compared to the food labeled vegan being chosen only 20 percent of the time.  \n\"The labeling effect was most pronounced for individuals who identified as red-meat eaters,\" the team wrote in their paper, which was presented at the Society for Risk Analysis 2023 Annual conference. \"\\[It\\] was consistent across socio-demographic groups.\"\n\nHowever there was no link whatsoever.  Ancedotal evidence is bad too and although it's just one online experiment, it shows a tendency for shoppers to associate \"plant-based\" or \"vegan\" with negative connotations.",

        "comment": "I'm a plant abuser and the human race are a monstrous plague on this earth. Veganism is primarily about the abuse, exploitation and commodification of animals for food, leather, feathers, wool etc, entertainment like zoos, aquariums, racing, theatrical/recorded visual media, pet ownership etc and labour like police/airport security, farming (and much later on down the track when a substitute exists more prominently; aged care and medicine). Yes all life is important in the grand scheme of things but not all life is under constant abuse and exploitation like these are. And the subsequent benefits of switching to a plant based/vegan lifestyle are becoming more recognised as benefits for all other life. Slaughterhouse workers are incredibly depressed and suicidal, underdeveloped countries are being cruelly exploited for their resources to support the larger animal ag industry that supplies more developed nations. Crop deaths, land clearing and effluent runoff destroying insect, mammal and plant biodiversity(this applies to our life giving oceans btw). On top of that, getting the average to go vegan teaches them a level of compassion the didn't know they had and as we progress as movement when there is more focus on doing what's right, you'll have more than enough support to focus on the niche things that are important to you. I mean I'd love to start a campaign freeing labour animals cos I hate work and I know I'd rather laze about doing the things I want. But most agree that it isn't the most impactful thing to be focusing on. Get people vegan, prolong/halt climate change and buy time for us to fight these smaller things that drive our individual passions.",

You're using utilitarian language -- talking about weighing various actions against each other -- but you're still using it to decide whether a person themselves is 'good' or 'bad'.\n\n&gt;Going back to the \"kill two, save one\" thing, imagine a corrupt vet. You have three sick dogs, Jerry, Susie, and Bowie, and bring them in. He saves two of them, and sells Bowie for animal testing. Would you view that as a good doctor?\n\nI don't particularly care whether a person themselves is 'good' or 'bad'. And why should I? I'm not concerned with the weight of one's soul. I leave that to you and your God (if you have one). At the end of the day, I want a world where good things happen... and so I am concerned with the actions themselves -- whether the things we do are good or bad.\n\nAnd when that is your concern, the calculus becomes much easier. Is it better when a mass shooter only has access to a pistol, and so manages to shoot 5 people instead of the 50 if he had had a semi-automatic? Yes. It is far better. If a doctor saves my mother and kills my father that is a better thing than a doctor who only kills my father.\n\nI hope that helps clear up the utilitarian stance a bit (at least as I see it).",

I said that being vegan on Thanksgiving does more good than being vegan on any other day, for example last Tuesday when you came home and ate spaghetti while watching the news. When you're vegan alone, you're boycotting harmful industries, but when you're vegan around nonvegans, you're passively disrupting. It's like a form of outreach or protest. So a vegan on Thanksgiving (especially Thanksgiving) is more effective than a vegan last Tuesday. In fact, eating animals and animal products when people know you as a vegan does more harm on that day than any nonvegan doing the same because you reinforce carnist values.",

I don't think you can attribute all of the outcome differences to the diet change.",

My mom doesn't have a job, and my Step-Dad doesn't make a lot of money. Meat and animal products is our best option to get the energy we need to not go hungry. Vegan food is expensive.

I guarantee most bad breath woes will be quelled with proper dental hygiene. I use a TON of garlic and onions, and loooove spicy food. \n\nEdit: I'm super serious about the flossing. Do me a favor: next time you floss, just smell the gunk you pull out from between your teeth. Then you will know why you have bad breath.",

We tend to be very picky about it, and it's pricy (and a lot tastes like vomit).\n\nTacos are a fantastic idea because they are so versatile.\n\nWe make two types of tacos a lot.\n\nFor one, we take a sweet potato, a potato, a couple of carrots, half an onion, a couple bell peppers (orange, yellow or red are best) and dice it all up.\n\nQuickly boil the potatoes, then start sauteeing the onions and peppers as well as some minced garlic. Add in everything else. Cook a little. Add water and taco seasoning (check ingredients, most are vegan. We actually buy a taco dinner kit for these).\n\nWhile we're doing that we take a rinsed and drained can of beans (black or red) and simmer them in a little olive oil, a little broth, and garlic.\nOnce they are soft, we mash them up.\n\nWe serve the potato stuff as a filling. We assemble them by taking a tortilla and coating it with the bean spread, then putting a taco shell inside and filling it with the potatoes.\n\nIt's insanely good and very simple.\n\nWe also do a similar thing except for the filling we ruse crumbled roasted tofu and lots of veggies. \n\nA good guacamole would be a nice addition, and that's also very easy to make (I'd have it all the time but my husband is allergic to avocados) though avocado toast sounds yummy as well.\n\nDepending where you live, if you can find Upton's Naturals Chorizo Seitan, that would be an awesome addition. There's also the Beyond Meat southwestern flavor that is sold in most Whole Foods. Both are yummy, Upton's is better though.\n\nI think that sounds like a really fun meal for a date. If you want to make it more fun, make lots of different toppings and options, set them out in all kinds of different dishes on the table, and experiment with making them together.",

        "comment": "No it is not, and not only because of animal welfare. Here's the definition of veganism from the subreddit sidebar; it's a quote from The Vegan Society (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt; A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—**all forms of exploitation of**, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.\n\nAs someone else on this thread stated, forcing an animal to do something to benefit humans that it wouldn't normally do is inherently exploitation. Domestication of carnivorous animals (especially cats and dogs) is also problematic because these animals contribute to the consumption of meat (thereby contributing to more environmental problems) and significantly threaten native wildlife populations. This is why pet ownership, service dogs, police dogs, therapy animals etc. are not considered vegan.\n\nThere are also ethical reasons not to use dogs in the police force - the reaction of a K9 unit currently provides legal justification to search people without a warrant, when we know that these animals very frequently give false positives and are trained to react on command. They can be and are exploited to become tools of police brutality, where unnecessary violence can be inflicted by a K9 unit and no police offers take the blame because they're not the ones who directly inflicted it. [Here's some further reading on this topic.](https://socialistworker.org/2018/07/17/using-dogs-as-a-tool-of-racist-repression)\n\nAnother reason why emotional support animals are also illegitimate because they perform no specific, discrete role to assist people unlike service animals. [There is no scientific evidence to show that they have any benefit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_support_animal#Lack_of_scientific_evidence)\n\nUltimately wherever you see humans removing animals from their natural habitat for our own purposes, you see exploitation, abuse and environmental destruction. With the climate emergency and water, air, soil and material pollution all rapidly getting worse; mass species extinction already taking place; and rain forests over the burning down - we should be collectively focusing on reducing the vastly negative impact our existence has on the planet. By extension this means we should be reducing animal exploitation and suffering as much as possible, so no, using animals for own purposes, including to perform work, is not vegan.",

Some may not want to, but barring some medical or food access problem (as some, like some minors and prisoners, have), it is absolutely possible. \n\n\"If you are thinking of  ‘going vegetarian’  give yourself a year.\"\n\nOne certainly doesn't need a year to go vegetarian, let alone vegan, especially if you take the lives of other animals seriously. I think we need to stop underestimating ourselves and others. I see no reason to act like such stalling is a necessary step. \n\nGo vegan. If you *choose* not to -- immediately or otherwise --  that is your choice, but it is a choice. Giving up meat and other animal products is hardly martyrdom.   \n\nIn any case, this post isn't even about veganism, except for the brief mention as if veganism is so impossibly hard.",

We hear this kind of stuff all the time, living in a mostly nonvegan world, but why do people so often feel the need to mention these kinds of details when they are speaking to vegans? You do realize that you are in a subreddit *full* of people to whom the idea of a \"blue steak\" (or any other animal product really) is offensive and heartbreaking...right? \n\nI'm really not trying to chastise you here, and I think that it must be something subconscious that compels you and others to make this kind of comment to vegans. I'm just wondering what was happening in your psychological process when you decided to include those details in your comment.",

This could give you another motivation to stay vegan, as well as [What the Health](https://youtu.be/_Sic3O1iHvA) on Netflix, if you can empathize with humans better than animals. (These documentaries both go over the ways the animal ag industry fucks over poor people and humanity in general though). \n\nFinally, if you’ve watched both documentaries I highly recommend watching [How one person makes a difference](https://youtu.be/d6fG1my3SFg).\n\nBest of luck!",

I am not sure whether you're intentionally failing to grasp my point because you feel like arguing, or if it was an honest failure of reasoning.\n\nOf course I realize the USA is one of the most prosperous nations. Of course I realize it's relatively easy to be vegan here. That's exactly why I made the point about US vegans making the same complaints you make. If someone can whine about \"restaurants don't have any vegan food\" in the USA, then I know that there are people who don't really try very hard to look around them and make changes, eg by researching or talking to servers. I have no way of knowing if you are one of these people who whines and says there's no vegan food when there really is. I DO NOT KNOW. Thanks for shouting what I already said and telling me I'm right, I'm not sure what you hope to accomplish.\n\nI didn't \"call you out.\" I explained why so many of us with quite reasonably regard your claims with skepticism. None of us can know for certain whether you are just a lazy whiner, or whether it's genuinely hard to find vegan food. But when you say there are literally no vegan condiments whatsoever, it proves that to some degree, you have stupid misconceptions about vegan food. This may be an isolated case of ignorance, or it may go further... but it's definitely evidence of ignorance in your approach to finding vegan food.\n\nHonestly, I probably wouldn't have responded to you in the first place if it weren't for the condiment line. Not only did you say something stupid, that you need fancy vegan condiments, but you said that unless you have fancy specialized vegan condiments, you have to go with * literally no condiments whatsoever.* This is hyperbolic and dramatic. For me, that colored the tone of everything else you wrote.",

All cheese is inherently vegetarian-friendly so for this company to market \"cheddar style singles\" sounded more like dairy-free vegan \"cheese\" to me. The other element here is the fact that I found this in a Safeway in the soy section next to Daiya, Chao, Field Roast, tofu, and other vegan-friendly soy products. So ultimately the labeling and the product's location lead me to feel confident enough to buy it without reading the ingredients more closely.",

So of course that data says they are harmful, because it is skewed in that direction, or was that too complicated to figure out? \n\nAll moral institutions? There are moral institutions that say it's okay to have slaves and murder gays. Doesn't mean we should listen to them. As being with love and compassion, each person should only do what is morally right for themselves and those that they care about, without taking the life and if possible avoiding harm on any other being that can feel pain. That is it. No one needs to because it is insane and has such a small following. \n\nNo you aren't, people who are mentally ill and decide to commit suicide aren't in the right state of mind to make that decision and don't have the right to do so. Thinking that someone should have the right to kill themselves, even if they are mentally unstable is the insane thought. You are the one who is truly evil if you would let someone kill themselves because you believe it is \"their right\". \n\nWould not have even wasted my time commenting if I knew you were insane from the start.",

Eat something, then reconsider how you feel. \n\nI don't get meat cravings, but I do crave rich and hearty meals. \n\nBBQ sauce usually hits the spot for me, either via a good burger or cauliflower wings. \n\nYou can also try to find a great meat substitute, I love seitan and it makes for the perfect BLT. \n\nIf you can, try the impossible burger or the beyond burger. \n\nIf substitutes aren't for you, try a naturally meaty plant like mushrooms or jackfruit (mushrooms aren’t plants, I know).\n\n&gt;I’ve noticed my eating habits are completely out of whack. I’m eating probably once a day, and because of this I’m getting headaches throughout my day. Do you guys have suggestions, books, videos on portions and what a proper meal should consistent of?\n\nI'd suggest you sign up to Challenge22, a free 22\\-day long vegan challenge designed to make the transition as easy as possible. They'll guide you through every step of the process and help you develop a personalised meal plan. They've done all the hard work for you already.",

What has more benefit for animal suffering: convincing one person to eat more plant-based, or getting a hundred vegans to use medicine without one iota of animal by-products? By micro-analyzing things like this, it could convince people that vegans are overly obsessive about everything. This would be a general turn-off for people looking into being vegan.\n\nMaybe, if we were more welcoming and sensible about these things, we could attract just a few more people to eat plant-based. I think that makes a whole lot more difference then lots of vegans taking completely vegan medicine.\n\nAfter all, why are we vegan in the first place? If we are vegan for health reasons... it's simple, take your meds. If we are vegan for ethical reasons, then we care about reducing animal suffering. And we care about making the world a more vegan place. While I can understand the need to express anger towards the mistreatment of animals, we need to understand that venting that anger can cause harm to the vegan movement. That anger can tarnish the image of vegans. That anger can prevent people from becoming vegan. \n\nWe want to build an inclusive vegan world, not an exclusive vegan club. And you win people over with kindness and acceptance.\n\nI would encourage every vegan to read [this](http://www.veganoutreach.org/howvegan.html). In fact, read as many articles from [Vegan Outreach](http://www.veganoutreach.org/advocacy/index.html) as you can. I love their philosophy of acceptance and how they focus on the largest source of animal suffering; factory farming.",

My upper level class on issues in agriculture was the only balanced view class and if you could have been there when peta was there you would have been appalled by the insincerity of the students. We're doing farm animal medicine in vet school currently and I'm amazed by the number of students who are saying the only reason they are tolerating the course is because cows are tasty.

        "comment": "I have a problem with killing things at all. There’s no reason to eat meat other than the taste, and 5 years without it I wouldn’t want it anyway.\n\n Meat is a known carcinogen, as is dairy. why increase the risk of cancer in yourself for a pizza or a burger when you can make the same things without those cancer causing foods? Vegan diets have been show to actually reduce heart disease and the risks for it. \n\nSlaughterhouse workers and people that live near factory farmers suffer greatly from injuries, illnesses, and death from poor working conditions and the horrific amounts of waste factory animals make and is then pumped out into the nearby soil and rivers. Veganism isn’t just for the animals, it’s a human rights and health issue. \n\nIf we suddenly were able to take back all the land wasted on factory farms, we could reforest the world and/or actually be able to feed more people. Cows eat about 80% of all soybeans grown, which means that’s a whole hell of a lot of tofu and soy milk that could be made instead of wasting it feeding cows. \n\nCows by the way are cause for 46% of rainforest deforestation due to land having to be cleared for farms. But it’s not just cows, chickens and fish and pork are all just as nonsensically bad for our resources and environment. For every 1 tuna the fishermen catch, 10 other random sea creatures died. There’s no such thing as Dolphin Safe Tuna because it’s not enforced at all. \n\nAnd those are just a small handful of reasons meat and dairy are horrific. They can literally kill you, they’re not sustainable, and it’s toxic for our environment. \n\nThere’s so many good books and documentaries to learn more from, I haven’t read or watched everything but I’ll list what I have:\n\n-What the Health, documentary about how meat is toxic to us\n-Seaspiracy, documentary about fishing\n\n-When Elephants Weep by Jeffery Moussaieff Mason, about how all animals have emotional and intelligent brains\n\n-Don’t Eat This Book by Morgan Spurlock. He’s not vegan and says as much but a lot of the info in here about American fast food and eating was horrific to think about, and considering that fast food is 90% meat and cheese it was very interesting\n\nI know I dropped a lot of words on your head, but going vegan is the best thing I’ve ever done for myself, even compared to being a vegetarian. \n\nI was a vegetarian for 5 years and went vegan a month ago and the difference in my physical health is night and day. My skin has cleared up, my stomach doesn’t hurt, I don’t wake up with a sore throat every day, and I get to go to bed every night and sleep well knowing I’m doing something beneficial to me, mankind, and our beloved planet\n\nThanks for your curiosity I hope you find l the answers you could ever want. Feel free to ask more questions anytime.",

It minimizes my carbon footprint.  \n2. It minimizes the risk of heart disease (my grandfather died of this).  \n3. I can't stand the thought of eating something that once had its own thoughts and desires.",

It just gets tiresome to hear the same old jokes all the time, about the same thing day after day. It doesn't bother me when someone shoves bacon in my face and says \"HEY MISTER VEGAN DONTCHA WANT SOME BACON OH WAIT HAHAHAHAHA\", but wouldn't you think the novelty of doing this would wear off over time? It reminds me of people who purposely go up to smokers and start coughing loudly. Not bullying, just obnoxious.\n\nI don't feel intimidated into hiding it at all. I don't go around advertising it, but if I am asked about it I will happily talk about it. Many people actually are genuinely interested, especially once I mention the fact that I don't believe veganism is for everyone.",

There are large 'swap' posts on Sundays where it's easy to try a variety of brands from one transaction.\n\nMany of the small-scale perfumers are entirely vegan, and those that aren't tend to make it clear if a fragrance has real honey etc. I tend to like perfumes with tobacco, vanilla, wood, dirt, and musk notes so it really depends on your taste.  \n  \nMy favorite at the moment is Nocturne Alchemy Santalum, which is just a really amazing sandalwood perfume but is very nuanced (kind of like chocolate that has 'cherry' and other notes). I think it would smell equally good on a guy or girl. I've also liked many that I've sampled from Solstice Scents and Possets. My favorite from Solstice Scents is Cascade of Gold, and Nuut from Possets (vanilla and freshly-turned dirt). Deconstructing Eden, Haus of Gloi, and Firebird are other perfumers who have entirely vegan companies that I've heard good things about.",

Humans have come a long way in regards to the environment and veganism is more popular than ever, with more and more advancements towards the lifestyle. We didn't \"blow it\" like you're trying to imply, it's a process, and a long one. It is not only ethically inconsistent but but pretty edgy to just throw your own kind under the bus cause what we've done to the environment.\nThe earth was here millions of years before us and will probably be millions of years after us. I really can't stand that defeatist mentality you've adopted. All life is sacred, human and animal, and we should treasure all of it.",

Checking it every couple days just reaffirms my beliefs that veganism is the right approach to life, and keeps me from caving for that \"one little piece of milk chocolate.\" Anyway, to specify, I have completely cut out animal products in my diet, but I still own several other non-food animal products. I have a leather belt, an expensive pair of boots, wool sweaters and socks, and a down jacket and duvet. I have been agonizing over what to do with these. I obviously will not be purchasing any more products like these from now on, but is it wrong to keep these things I had before I went vegan? Can I even call myself a vegan? I mean, how hypocritical of me to talk about veganism while holding up my pants with some cow's skin, you know? I have this idea that I paid for these things, so I should get my use out of them. Is that flawed logic? What are your thoughts on keeping/wearing animal products you had bought before you went vegan?",

If I'm an apple sauce maker, and I can sell my apple peels as a separate product instead of paying to have them disposed of, I make extra profits on top of my apple sauce, and continue to thrive as a business.  Vegans do not want to support the dairy industries, byproducts or not.  Hence we also won't buy and drink blood from slaughterhouses, even though it may pollute nearby water if not properly disposed of.",

Would you rather everyone who abstains from using animal products call themselves \"strict vegetarian\", but if they are doing it because of animal exploitation they get to call themselves vegan?

Buuuuut, if it were a design that perhaps only vegans or people in the know would get, something esoteric for lack of a better word, then maybe I'd go for it. Even a design like Tolin suggested that isn't outwardly obvious and preachy. \n\nAnd then we can do the secret vegan handshake when we see each other. \n\nHmm, maybe incorporate the reddit logo into it. The coat of arms has bacon in it. Maybe make a new one with a stalk of celery. Or the reddit alien making friends with a pig. Not really, but you get the idea.",

People can have their own opinions or whatever but I think people with the no pets / would you feed your pets meat are pedantic (not sure if that’s the right word but I can’t think of a better one). \n\nLike, is your alternative to say fuck all the pets and let them die? That’s not really vegan. And then where their diets are concerned, are they saying keep unhealthy animals? That’s also not very vegan. \n\nI’ve seen animals on a vegan diet that were wildly unhealthy. I’ve also seen animals on a dry food diet that were wildly unhealthy. When I had a dog, I’d feet mine a raw meat diet that was recommended to me by dog experts. I wasn’t exactly thrilled about feeding them big chunks of meat, but at the same time it didn’t bother me because... it is what it is. I can see how it’s hypocritical to do this, maybe. But I’d rather be a hypocrite with a healthy animal than to be seen as morally correct with an animal that’s miserable, unhealthy or getting dietary issues. A lot of animals already have dietary issues because of breeding so... \n\nIt’s like, a tricky situation but I think if you’re loving a pet nobody can really call you a dickhead. Zoos and aquariums are a different issue but I think if you’re someone that has a problem with someone having a pet you just need to get a fucking life. \n\n(Not you personally OP lol)",

That way I don't have to decline and feel the eensiest bad that I'm declining a nice gesture. \n\nBut, it doesn't really matter to me. Either way, I don't think it's that big of a deal. It's really awesome that you are so considerate though in trying to figure out how to go about it in the best way!\n\nThe only thing that does bother me is when people say--oh, you CAN'T eat this right? I'm not sure why that irks me so much. I can eat it but I won't, and I don't feel deprived.",

You being physically fit squashes a lot of myths about veganism instantly.\n\nThere's tons of research that people trust and respect more healthy/attractive looking people. Why do you think free lee has so many more views than the much more informative Unnatural vegan? Humans are vain petty creatures. Yes body shaming is bad and should be discouraged, yes telling people they should work out can be ableist or classist but I firmly believe being physically fit is a great boon to our movement. Animals don't care why you're not eating them, if its for vain reasons so be it if it means less dead animals.",

I also enjoy oatmeal topped with any fruit or nut imaginable (berries, banana, apple, stone fruits, dried fruits, shredded coconut, almonds, walnuts, candied ginger, nut butters, pumpkin puree, granola, etc.). I have a hard time getting veggies into my breakfast (and I don't have time most mornings to cook myself a tofu scramble with spinach and mushrooms and peppers..mmm....).\n\nI think in general my advice is to just add veggies to everything.  Most things are improved with extra veggies if you think of it - a tofurky/seitan/tofu sandwhich is made infinitely better with lettuce, tomato, sprouts, pickles, peppers, saurkraut, onion, etc. Throw a handful of kale or spinach into a smoothie. Double the veggies in a tofu or seitan stir fry.  Snack on chopped up veggies (with hummus or other bean dip). Toast topped with smashed avocado, sprinkles with salt.  Apple slices dipped in peanut butter.  Soup is an easy vegetable delivery system - add extra veggies to your lentil or bean soups, chili, or just straight up veggie soup with quinoa or brown rice, or a pureed soup like (non-dairy) cream of broccoli or carrot/squash.  Man, I am making myself hungry.",

Vegans currently go to the shop and have to pick from a subset of what’s in there while omnis can get anything there. I bet you if their local supermarket was completely vegan and they had to go out of their way to get non-vegan food barely anyone would be omni.\n\n\nI bet you quitters most of the time they say to themselves “I’m just going to treat myself and get <random non-vegan product> and that’s it” and it snowballs from there or just a simple “uhhh can’t be bothered anymore”.\n\n\nHaving a completely vegan supermarket would genuinely make a huge difference to me. I do live in the UK so it’s not too bad but still. At least that’s my thoughts on it.",

        "comment": "I understand the sentiment, and certainly on the face of it seems to be neutral, but its being said in a world where the sexes aren't in fact treated equally.  The quote very likely was not intented to be sexist, but in the greater context of the world, it could easily be interpreted as such. Women through history and the modern day are much more likely to be victims of sexual assault, and their bodies are objectified to a much greater degree.  Just to be clear, I'm not saying that it isn't wrong when it happens to men.  When men are sexually assaulted it is wrong, and when men are given unrealistic expectations about their bodies, and treated like \"pieces of meat\" its wrong, but it happens a lot more with women then boys.\n\nI don't have an issue with adults posing nude and deciding what to do with their own bodies. I don't think its a particularly effective form of activism, because other people might.  Someone who subconsciously may want a reason to dismiss veganism can look at that quote, and see misogyny in a prominent vegan activist and speaker (Intended or not) and declare veganism anti-feminist.  They are wrong, and you could make the argument that veganism core philosophy is pro-women(what with all the non-human women suffering as result of animal agriculture), but ultimately the point of activism isn't really to win arguments, but to change minds.  Making it easier for people to be vegan is pro-animals.  What Gary Yourofsky said does not make it easier to sympathize with him(or his philosophies).",

        "comment": "No, because mock meat is a vegetarian food masquerading as meat, but we know it's not meat. Lab meat is a chemical product intended to be identical to real meat masquerading as a vegetarian food. *It's the opposite of mock meat.*\n\nMy previous experience with meat eaters is that they want any leverage to get a vegetarian to eat meat again, and as such you will find real meat being snuck into these products. The reasons will range from economic realities to smite.\n\nIf you get \"caught\" eating lab meat adulterated with real meat, you will be called a hypocrite or be told that you should \"just start eating meat again\". Why would you ever trust a person feeding you meat that is intended to be chemically identical to real meat that's it's not?",

The Mexican section is CHEAP. Get a pack of dried pinto beans and follow this recipe:\nhttp://allrecipes.com/recipe/refried-beans-without-the-refry/detail.aspx?event8=1&amp;prop24=SR_Title&amp;e11=refried%20beans&amp;e8=Quick%20Search&amp;event10=1&amp;e7=Home%20Page\nA quick basic hot sauce is nothing more than 8oz water and 8oz vinegar with 2 tbsp of garlic powder, onion powder, salt with 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper; I also add a tbsp of ground flax seed not just for the health reasons but mainly to thicken it up a bit. If you really wanna add some greens to your diet take two slices of whole grain bread slab on some stone ground mustard on each slice and add an inch worth of mustard greens and eat. I love it, but then again I love mustard. Dipping celery and carrots into mustard instead of ranch might not seem tasty, but try it, it is great. Also, you could take that hot sauce recipe i added above and just take out the cayenne for a tangy salad dressing, you will need the flax seed though to get it to stick to the leaves; you could use oil instead of ground flax seed, but why? Basically, as a vegan you will get the vast majority of your calories from starchy foods and will use fruits and veggies to give all sorts of amazing health benefits. Because fruits amongst themselves and grains amongst themselves are pretty similar, my only recommendation of what types of foods to buy would be in the vegetable area. I recommend focusing on the Allium and Cruciferous vegetables based on this research:\nhttp://nutritionfacts.org/video/1-anticancer-vegetable/\nLastly, I'd like to add that if you add some cinnamon and raisins and a little soy-milk to your oatmeal in the morning it will almost taste like you're eating a desert. good stuff.",

        "comment": "What worked for me was just eat more. Your stomach will adapt to be handling more volume of food. I can gain weight nowadays by just eating a wholefood plantbased diet without even touching junkfood. I can continue eating way after the point of being sated, and I also have to do it in order to hold my weight (I am a rockclimber who does ~20 hours sports/week so I need a lot of food).\n\nSo my simple advice: Eat even more.\n\nApart from this I am also on the lower end of BMI (actually I am exactly at 20). But as I also said I do have to even watch not to eat too much nowadays otherwise I actually put on weight despite all the sports I am doing. I do however know how you are feeling - I had the same problem before I figured out how much I actually need to eat.\n\nAnd yes, don't listen to people recommending junk food. There is noneed to eat that crap. Saying this as somebody who also breaks out from one single chocolate cookie. :/",

In this day and age, there is no need for animal products to be healthy, you can thrive on a healthy plant-based diet rather than an average meat eater.\n\n\nSo I pose a question, why choose pain when you can be compassionate??",

If I am wrong in this, please correct me.\n\nAs you made mention of, there is work required to achieve this: people must put an effort into it, researching, problem solving, experimenting; capital must be pooled to pay wages to the people making such efforts, to buy the equipment, ingredients, *et cetera*, for ideas to be tried; and the processes may be analyzed and re-examined to find more efficient methods, or obtain better results.  There is much to be done, is there not?\n\nYet, with all of this work that needs doing, you claim that we *cannot* help to quicken any aspect of it.  Why can we not?\n\nIs it the case that vegans simply do not know enough to aid in the process?  Do vegans lack the intelligence to research, or solve problems, or experiment?  What is more, if vegans do lack such intelligence, can they never hope to gain it, so making study and education a futile pursuit for vegans, as well?\n\nDo vegans have no capital to invest in the furtherance of the development of such technologies?  Are vegans incapable of calling for such products to be brought to market, thereby signalling increasing demand, attracting others to invest their capital in the hope of increasing their own wealth?\n\nCan vegans not look and think?  Can vegans not tinker?  Can vegans not ponder what might work better than the current methods?  Can vegans not probe a system and wonder if it might be made a little more efficient here; or an end-product a little more tasty, or have its texture improved, by this or that change?\n\nWhat is it that makes vegans--and not them, whoever they are that are accomplishing such feats at a rate we cannot hope to better, or even aid their own betterment of--incapable of carrying a portion of the burden?\n\nDo vegans simply lack the motivation?\n\nIt is a problem to be solved--one of many--and if solutions are not found by vegans, then we might not be surprised that the solutions adopted are themselves not vegan.\n\n[Edit:  Fixing a small typo.]",

I've never been anywhere they didn't have a vegan option or were happy to adjust an existing dish to make it vegan.\n\nThere are probably plenty of farmers markets, but I just tend to shop at normal supermarkets (everywhere sells soy margarine, all kinds of non-dairy milks, tofu etc.), and get vegan mayo/soy cheese from health food shops.",

I couldn’t stop thinking about it for weeks. I cried while I was watching it and I almost never cry at movies. I don’t know if you’re as sensitive as I am, but I recommend it to anyone struggling. It really puts things into perspective and it makes you want to try harder. At least, it did for me.",

Like you, I theorised how it would make vegans look and for me it's just not true - a theory is just that (a theory). \n\nPeople seem to think this pledge means not eating with your family. It's not true. My dad will actually eat more vegan food with me after the pledge because he says he's happy to eat vegan instead if it means spending time with me. He doesn't feel forced to but actually wants to :)",

And energy is no where near to being sustainable. Coal, oil and natural gas still make up a vast portion of the US energy grid. We'd be doing way better with water and energy if we weren't wasting it on animal agri.",

People who think themselves as if not eating meat is going to change the world just give vegan a bad rep, some of us do it for health and yes, some values we would like to maintain. But it's not about discriminating and thinking we're the only ones who are right.\n\nIf it were like you said you would go to a mechanic to fix the car and expect him to say \"that metal thingy part\" instead of the actual name? I don't think so.\n\nThis is seriously a stupid discussion. If you wanna hear me out and explain why the menu says what it says then do so. If you wanna go by a simple dictionary then yes, meat is meat even if it's from a rat, even if it's from a human. All I say is be open minded, if you want people to respect you for being vegan and for what you believe in then respect other people too.",

They don't eat anything but meat in nature- without careful supplementing of an artificial, plant-derived diet, their bodies just straight-up fall apart. \n\nI just struggle to see how anyone following a vegan lifestyle for ethical reasons could justify having a cat to themselves. Either you're keeping an animal around for your enjoyment at the cost of countless sentient lives in factory farms, negating the good you're attempting to do by shunning the products of those nightmares yourself, or you're risking feeding a creature wholly dependent on you sustenance that's sufficiently nutritionally deficient to threaten its life. Beyond that- you're either keeping an intelligent creature confined within your dwelling with no stimulation but that which you deign to provide for it yourself, or you're letting it live out something close to a natural life, and letting it wreak havoc on the regional wildlife. \n\nThat cats are \"just feeding as they naturally evolved\" doesn't matter in the slightest- *domestic* cats occupy a profoundly dysfunctional moral position. They're not fed by hunting- they tend to be fed by some of the absolute worst factory farms around, with that food administered by owners who keep the cat around, irrespective of the harm they facilitate by doing so, for their own personal enjoyment. \n\nCats eating meat isn't a choice. *Keeping* a cat very much is. \n\nIt bugs the hell out of me, since I  absolutely adore cats. But I just can't justify keeping one.",

When you say you're only vegan for health reasons, since there are no health reasons to e.g. avoid leather or buy products not tested on animals, it's extremely safe to assume that you mean you only eat a plant-based diet.\n\nWhat doesn't count as being vegan is just eating plant-based food, but continuing to exploit animals in other ways.\n\nDo you care about the ethical reasons to be vegan?",

Eat something, then reconsider how you feel. \n\nI don't get meat cravings, but I do crave rich and hearty meals. \n\nBBQ sauce usually hits the spot for me, either via a good burger or cauliflower wings. \n\nYou can also try to find a great meat substitute, I love seitan and it makes for the perfect BLT. \n\nIf you can, try the impossible burger or the beyond burger. \n\nIf substitutes aren't for you, try a naturally meaty plant like mushrooms or jackfruit (mushrooms aren’t plants, I know).\n\n&gt;I’ve noticed my eating habits are completely out of whack. I’m eating probably once a day, and because of this I’m getting headaches throughout my day. Do you guys have suggestions, books, videos on portions and what a proper meal should consistent of?\n\nI'd suggest you sign up to Challenge22, a free 22\\-day long vegan challenge designed to make the transition as easy as possible. They'll guide you through every step of the process and help you develop a personalised meal plan. They've done all the hard work for you already.",

It's not justified to breed them to begin with because we don't need them. If we needed them for progress that would be different, but animal agriculture is a needless burden on Earth. Simply being alive isn't good enough. It's not justified to kill someone unless it's necessary, &amp; animal agriculture is far from necessary: it's destructive across the board. \n\nDo you think both of these scenarios are bad? Assume I can live fine without raising the fish.\n\n1. I raise vegetarian fed fish that have a natural lifespan of 10 years, I kill them after 2 years, I eat them\n\n2. I raise vegetarian fed fish that have a natural lifespan of 10 years, I wait 10 years for them to die, I eat them\n\nOn a separate thought, is not life a needless burden on the Earth?",

You vote with your money, but if you're staying at home, they have no idea why. \n\nKeeping vegan options on a menu also exposes more people to the idea of eating vegan and gives more people the opportunity to try vegan dishes. I feel like most people are more likely to order an unfamiliar vegan dish in a restaurant than try to make it at home. And from my observations, a huge hurdle to getting people to eat less meat is making vegetarian and vegan dishes seem less weird.",

Where you are along that continuum is personal choice. \n\nExisting causes harm. \n\nI mean, if we're going to take veganism to the extremist, most pure definition...I hope no one is wearing clothes, using transportation or living in a house unless you built it by hand out of stone and wood. Right now, there are so many animal products in the littlest things...it is almost impossible to avoid. \n\nI also wonder how successful any sort of widespread change is going to be. I know a lot of omni's who are horrified by factory farming, general abuse of animals/circuses etc. But they will NOT go vegan or even consider any sort of animal rights' activism etc. simply because they encounter 'extremist vegans' who make them feel like keeping their pet is abuse or using language like slavery or Holocaust. The whole thing turns them off and the behaviour of the extremists means their message is lost and no one wants to validate or consider 'the message' because they associate it with 'the nutjobs'. Hell it terrifies *me* and I'm making the transition. I don't want to be associated with nor represent those types of people at all. \n\nOverall it is sad---because if only they would stop screaming about how XYZ is really slavery or abuse or having companion animals is exploitation how dare you you greedy human...a lot more people would be interested in it.",

Of course your body takes it from you. And your B12 supplement isn’t actually B12. \n\nJust because you needed someone to confirm your belief system doesn’t mean it’s right. \n\nIt’s def not fair you had to pay for it and she should have told you beforehand. \n\nYes, nuts and seeds are some of the worst things you can eat for auto immunity and inflammation. \n\nI don’t think there’s a way out here for you ://  at least not one you’d like. \n\nGreetings from a former vegan with severe auto immunity.

        "comment": "I think your main problem is that you're not familiar with the options out there for you - you said it yourself, you skip lunch 'due to not knowing what to eat'. Don't worry, that's easily fixed - it will take time and practice, but your knowledge of (and taste for) vibrant and varied vegan foods will increase almost organically. There have been lots of good meal suggestions in the comments, and coming to reddit is a good place to start for meal inspiration. Otherwise, try tumblr, pinterest, instagram - all of which are a minefield of vegan food ideas. Follow other vegan users, see if anything they're eating seems nice, ask how they made it, etc. \n\nAnother good way to branch out without putting in too much effort is to make *small* changes to the way you're currently eating. You say you have hummus on toast for breakfast. Make a small tweak to change it up - swap plain hummus for a different flavour, buy guacamole instead, or even a different condiment altogether (jam, peanut butter, almond butter, vegan spreads...). OR a different bread - bagels, crumpets, rye bread, etc. etc. You like jacket potatoes - try a sweet potato instead! Pasta is super easy and quick, and Tesco do lots of pre-made sauces, many of which are cheap and vegan. (I posted this huge [list](http://realfood.tesco.com/media/docs/Vegan-June-2013-ec29f63d-81f8-402b-85d1-a23a5acfb2d9-0.pdf) of Tesco's vegan foods to show just how many options there actually are!).\n\nI feel like you might be avoiding fruit and veg - why is that? Do you not like them or do you feel like it's too much expense/hassle? Try challenging yourself to buying one bag of fruit a week and just working through it. Bananas (good on toast with peanut butter) one week, apples the next (etc) - it really isn't expensive, done that way. Veg can require some preparation, OR NOT if you buy frozen or tinned vegetables. Why not put some sweetcorn on your jacket potato? \n\n\nIn terms of lunch, the best thing you can do is at least have some fruit, nuts or a vegan cereal in your bag - that way, you won't be running on empty in the worst case scenario that you can't find anything to eat.\n\n\nHope this helps a little!",

        "comment": "As a formerly fat vegan, I have to admit that Dr. McDougal is right on the money. Now, I know that what he is saying may offend some of you and I know that you may simply not want to hear what he is saying, but please take it from someone who has been through all of this. \n\nBefore you reject the idea of moving towards a healthier vegan diet, let me ask you two questions: What is your current age, and how long have you been vegan? I went vegan in 1992 at age 19 for purely ethical motives. Back then, I was pretty much forced to be a \"healthy\" vegan, as there just wasn't access to all of the countless vegan processed foods that there are today. As these products started emerging in the mid 90s, I was irresistibly drawn to them, as I was now getting to enjoy foods that I thought I had given up forever! (Ice cream, hot dogs, store bought cookies, candy, etc..)\n\nBy five years into my veganism, I was a full fledged junk food vegan. Luckily, I was still fairly young, so I was still able to cope (for the most part) with an unhealthy diet. As the years wore on, however, my weight increased and my health diminished. From years 5 through 15 of being vegan (ages 25-35), I gained 10 pounds per year. I went from ~165 pounds to ~265 pounds, all because I was held deeply in the trap of food addiction. I was still a true blue ethical vegan, avoiding even bone char sugar and honey, but I was treating myself horribly. One of the biggest problems with being an overweight, sickly vegan, is that it can be difficult to be an inspiration to others. People would look at me and correlate my appearance and health with \"veganism\", and it actually turned them off to veganism. After a while, I stopped telling people altogether that I was vegan. I was embarrassed and ashamed.\n\nEventually, I got fed up and after 15 years, I switched to a 100% raw vegan diet. Immediately, things started changing for the better. I started feeling great and I started looking and feeling younger. Within a single year, I had reversed a decade of self abuse. Five years on, I am slimmer and healthier, and feel younger then ever. I am currently in the best physical shape of my life. Not only that, but I have inspired thousands of people with my story and when I talk about animals, *they actually listen to me.* I am now bringing an animal-positive message to far, far more people today than I ever had in the past.\n\n[Please a take a look at this series of photos and study it carefully](http://i.imgur.com/aCJhN.jpg). Look at the image where I am at my heaviest and honestly ask yourself if you think I felt just fine, and if you feel I would have been a real inspiration to others. I can honestly tell you that I didn't and I wasn't.\n\nIf you are still young, or have only been vegan for a few years, just keep my photos in mind. I don't want to tell you what to eat or how to live, but please remember my story before you get all gung-ho against people who promote a healthy diet along side ethical veganism.",

        "comment": "Of course black lives matter, but you couldn't be more off base by saying that Veganism and the Black Lives Matter group go in hand. I'm vegan. Veganism calls for compassion to all beings, and police officers are included in that group of beings. Black Lives Matter calls for violence and harm to police and spreads false rhetoric about police, such as \"hands up don't shoot.\" That never happened. The story is based on a lie. Also when one of their founders calls on killing white people, please tell me how that is a foundation of veganism?\n\nAlso, what you're saying about this epidemic of police violence is just not true. Just look at the statistics. Police are far more likely to be murdered than someone is to be murdered by the police. The key word is murder, meaning premeditated. It is true that there are a number of police shootings every year, but when you consider that the overwhelming majority of these shootings were justified, either because the offender was shooting at people, or harming others, or running at the officers with a knife, etc. the amount of unjustified incidents are extremely low and pale in comparison to the number of officers murdered each year by the public. The lives of police matter, too, but this is somethings that Black Lives Matter does not care to acknowledge, and that's just plain wrong.\n\nIncidents like what happened in Minneapolis are awful, and the officer should be held accountable for what he did. But incidents like this are not common and saying that there is an epidemic of police violence is not a fair think to say. Black Lives Matter is an insult to every officer out there, especially black officers, that day in and day out risks their lives for a community that is often thankless and cold. They are the only ones that actually help communities ravaged by violence and gangs. They are the ones that run towards the violence when people in these communities are being killed by each other.\n\nWhy is it that Black Lives Matter is not there when a 15 year old basketball star, aspiring to join the NBA, was just murdered in New York when he was playing basketball. Or how about all the black on black violence in St. Louis, Baltimore, or Chicago. Or how about the fact that black males, who only represent around 6% of the U.S population, commit over 50% of all murders in the U.S.  I don't see Black Lives Matter there either.\n\nI find it sad that more people don't see it this way. Also by the way, with this Minneapolis incident, don't you find it sad that this mans death is being advertised on television and being sensationalized. Images like this are normalizing black men being killed and create this idea that showing black men dying on television is great content because it drives views. This shouldn't be normalized and should be something strongly advised against. The officer was arrested and he will likely go to prison. So why all the ensuing violence?\n\nYou are surely not being hunted and exterminated. This is just a terrible thing to say because it's just not true. What nearly every police incident boils down to is compliance. The majority of all these sensationalized incidents, you see lack of compliance. I've been held at gun point by the police before during an incident because they believed I was someone I wasn't based on a false report by a citizen. I listened and complied, and when all was said and done, they explained the situation, why they did what they did, and I walked home. And what you said about \"knowledge being the only cure,\" you are absolutely right. So use that knowledge, make an informed decision based on reality, and don't just accept as fact what the media or some group is telling you is the reality.",

They're animals of equal intellects, abilities, and capability for domestication, but two have soft fur and one doesn't. Globally, cats and dogs are also food animals, so it's not like they can't be used for food and pigs can. \n\nNot to mention that a trip to any animal shelter website shows what real animal abuse and neglect looks like...and it isn't feeding a kitty questionable vegan cat food (as if fuckin' Friskies is any good for them anyways...)",

So you would condemn my most innocent son to death by starvation. \n\nWhile I think a ban might make us feel better about ourselves and our choices to reduce our ecological footprint and reduce animal suffering not all of humanity can be obligate herbivores. \n\nHumanity is a big, complicated, and diverse population and rarely is there a universal truth or one size fits all approach that works.",

There is some studies that seem to indicate that casein has negative health consequences, but not meat in general.  I looked at the China study, it shows that plant based diets can be *just* as healthy as meat based and nothing more.  There is a lot of highly unscientific analysis that gets thrown around (comparing very different populations that get very different nutrient ratios, etc.)\n\nThe problem with the typical meat based diet is **too much** meat.  If you are eating low protein the rest of the day and small servings of meat that's just as healthy as a vegan diet (can be), and a vegan diet can be every bit as healthy as a meat diet.",

I don't mind it being surrounded by non-vegan cities as I'm already living in one. The cost of living isn't bad at all. A one bedroom apt is around $600 and 2 bedrooms around $700-800. Downtown is the best place to live and Whole foods is not too far from the Capital, which is the heart of Austin. \n\nEdit: The restaurant Veggie Heaven is awesome!",

Bivalves don't contain anything gross that will hurt you. Well, they can sometimes, but that goes for plants too. There are groups that carefully monitor quality sourced bivalves. They can contain trace metals, but those have been considered to be very low compared to other seafood, and within acceptable range. Plants can contain negative compounds, like arsenic in rice. \n\nThe point is the suffering of the animals, right? People will eat way less healthy items for taste, as long as it's vegan.",

Very accommodating people there, as well as in the other places I've been in south east Asia. But in most cites in SEA the idea of no fish (or fish based sauces) in the food confused locals. \n\nVancouver, Canada was great when I was there. Portland, Maine of all places was spectacular - there are if I remember correctly 7 fully veg*n restaurants. I had been in Boston (not far south of Portland) and was really disappointed with the food there. Portland is a funky city. I'd probably live there if I had the ability to deal with cold weather :D",

I would trust actual vegans from a vegan organization to determine what is and isn't vegan WAY more than I would trust the government to do it.

        "comment": "First of all, congratulations for your new lifestyle choice! We are cheering for you! Here are some tips from me:\n\n- RESTAURANT EATING\n\nI'm sure you can look up some info if there are any vegan restaurants in your area. \nIf you happen to go to a restaurant that isn't specifically catering to vegans I'm sure you can ask for a vegan meal that they can prepare for you such as a salad, or steamed vegetables or roasted vegetables.\n\n- SHOPPING\n\nFoods and products that are certified vegan, will have a vegan label on the product. Other products might have vegan ingredients listed but are likely to also say \"may contain traces of milk and eggs\" which means that that product may contain tiny traces of milk/eggs, because the product was packaged in the same facility as the products containing milk/eggs \n\nI believe whole vegan food is almost always cheaper than processed vegan food, so its budget friendly, such as: \n\n- PROTEIN RICH FOODS: \n\nBeans and Legumes, Whole Grains(Oats,Rice,Quinoa,Buckwheat...)\n\n- CARBS: \n\nVegetables: Fresh/Local &gt; Frozen &gt; Canned\n(Lettuce, Cabbage, Spinach, Kale, Asparagus, Eggplant, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Brussels Sprouts, Zucchini, Corn, Bell Peppers, Squash,Tomatoes, Carrots, Potatoes Mushrooms)\n\nFruit: Fresh/Local &gt; Frozen or Dried (Avoid dried and canned fruit with added sugar)\n\n- HEALTHY FATS (In moderation):  \n\nAvocado, Nuts, Seeds \n\n- MEAL IDEAS: Big Salads, Stews, Soups, Buddha Bowls , Burritos, Oatmeal, Risotto, Curry, Baked/Grilled Vegetables, Stuffed Bell Peppers...\n\nMeals that are great as a take out: Please google \"Buddha bowl\" and look at pictures to get some ideas what you could put together.\n\nAlso if you are interested in tracking nutrition in your food, get a free app on your phone called Cronometer\n(Website also exists: https://cronometer.com/)\n\nI recommend that you look up on google and youtube for some vegan recipes and some meal preps, as there are so many good ones, i would need pages to post them. \n\nIf you don't have time to make a healthy lunch every day, i recommend you make big batch once per week for the following week and freeze it. (Look up some vegan meals that freeze well) \n\n- COOKING?BAKING?STEAMING?\n\nAlso to learn how to properly cook beans and other foods to get the most nutrition out of it. \nBeans need to be cooked thoroughly/properly to avoid lectin poisoning (https://www.vegancoach.com/how-to-cook-beans.html)\nAvoid cooking vegetables (broccoli, cauliflour etc...) unless you are making soup or stew because the nutrients leach out of the vegetable and into the water, so you wouldn't want to throw that water away. If you aren't making soup/stew, then steam or bake/roast your vegetables instead. (My god so much info i should already be sleeping, rip)\n\n\n- SUPPLIMENTS\n\nIf you are eating an healthy overall non-restrictive vegan diet (example: Raw vegan diet is restricting) and you don't have any health issues (that would cause you to not absorb nutrients properly) then you are probably receiving enough nutrients, however you still should look into getting the following important suppliments:\nVitamin B12, Iodine and possibly EPA/DHA\n(Also i recommend you frequently visit your doctor to get those levels checked, once a year or so, to be on the safe side.)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is so much info on the vegan diet, how to do it right, so I recommend you check out couple of vegan doctors and dieticians on YouTube that offer great info on a healthy vegan diet that you can thrive on.\nYou can get some important info from them like (\"Why spinach isn't actually a good source of iron because it contains oxelates, etc.)\nPlease check them out, to make sure you do your diet properly and actually thrive on this diet.\n\nBrenda Davis R.D.\nDr. Joel Fuhrman\nDr. Micheal Klaper\nDr. Micheal Greger (Nutritionfacts.org)\n\nGojiMan (Great info on vegan nutrition and health)\n\nThis was the video by a vegan doctor about vegan nutrition which i based my own vegan diet on im so happy i came across it, hopefully it will help you too.\nhttps://youtu.be/IvlaQJImt9w",

        "comment": "&gt; well, here on reddit, the argument about not causing demand for animals to be slaughtered doesn't seem to be accepted. there was recently a thread about a guy who ate free cheese that was to be thrown away at his hotel job, and he was down voted to oblivion.\n\nSince I am mostly concerned with the ethical implications, I think there's nothing wrong with eating cheese that would be thrown away. This is a different scenario from eating cheese when you're someone's else's guest, though, since that *would* create demand. I suppose one technically wouldn't be vegan in that case, although the actions would be in line with the motivations of *being* a vegan, if that makes any sense.\n\n&gt; I am not vegan for any animal rights reasons. I just want to feel good and be healthy, and not get stuff stuck in my teeth.\n\nStrict vegetarian is probably a more accurate term then. The term \"vegan\" does have ethical motivations embedded in its definition. \n\n&gt; are there any data available about the proportion of meat to leather demanded or amount of discounting done on either to make up for excess?\n\nI'm not really sure what you mean. Are you asking how strong a demand for animal slaughter using leather (or other byproducts) creates?",

The nearest thing they did was a vegi burger so I never went in. After a couple of months of us going past and seeing no-one in there, it seems the shutters are down all the time now and I'm hoping they have gone bust as it serves them right for not looking ahead and catering to the ever growing market of those who have a long term interest in animals, the environment and their own health as they are satisfying their taste buds for a few seconds.",

        "comment": "&gt;The biggest question I have right now is will a vegan diet give me any disadvantages of any sort?\n\nNot because it's vegan, no. But anytime you switch your diet around you should put some thought and research into making sure it's well-balanced. While people tend to be healthier eating plant-based diets, simply avoiding animal products doesn't guarantee health and you can set yourself up for deficiencies -- just as non-vegans often do. \n\nPersonally, I find it easier to eat healthy as a vegan, especially when I stick to more whole foods and even more so when I eat lots of stuff raw. It's easy to eat healthy when you focus on eating lots of legumes, greens, and other veggies, some whole grains, fruit (especially for dessert or snacks) and a moderate amount of nuts and seeds. If you avoid greens and legumes, you might have a somewhat harder time getting enough calcium, iron and lysine, though. Protein in general is pretty easy to get enough of -- hardly the issue non-vegetarians suspect it is -- but the amino acid lysine is rather low in grains (but plentiful in legumes). Getting omega-3s is important, too, so enjoy stuff like walnuts, greens (purslane, especially, if you can find it locally -- it might even be in your yard, lol), olive oil, and especially flax (whether the oil or the seeds, though whole seeds don't digest well and are best ground up a bit).  \n\nAnd again, take a B12 supplement ;)",

It will settle out eventually, so don't worry too much. In the meantime, try to consume a little less fiber to soothe your system. It might have been better to gradually go about transitioning to veg so your body could get used to the higher amounts of fiber.\n\nFind some other recipes that don't rely so heavily on beans and fiber.\n\nhttp://www.vegweb.com",

Then I can prep some beans at the same time as the grain or use canned beans when meal time rolls around, add veggies of your choosing and sauce if you like, instant meal. I'm frequently too hungry to bother making a sauce, but I've found that if all of the individual components are seasoned well I don't feel like I'm missing out. Curry is also very simple to make if you keep curry paste and coconut milk on hand. Be sure to double check the ingredients in the curry paste for non vegan ingredients. \n\nMy go to preparation for veggies is to steam them then squeeze a bit of lemon and add some Spike (Salt free seasoning or Hot'n Spicy). Roasted veggies with a bit of olive oil and balsamic or pure maple syrup are great when the weather is cooler. \n\nGood luck!",

        "comment": "First I came out as gay while attending a parochial university in the early 90s. That cost me just about every friendship I had. Then I came out as an Atheist and rationalist while we were around 3% of the population, not 30%. So coming out as a vega has been incredibly easy.\n\nHere are a few tips that have helped me and others over the years.\n\nIf you tell someone you're gay in a whisper, in the shadows with doubt and fear in your voice then that is very likely what will be echoed back to you in others. But if you behave as if its just about as unusual as being left handed with absolutely no shame or disdain then that is exactly how others will accept you with it. You are teaching other the correct response to being vegan. You show it in your actions and your words. \n\nBut, there are a few out spoken people who will push their preconceived notions when given the opportunity. Fortunately, there are very easy techniques to keep your courage up, disarm them and still keep the tension low. My fav for beginners is borrowed from assertiveness training. Its called fogging because no matter what the aggressor does to fog, they can never push or control it. It is very easy too. All you do is agree with them. Sounds counter intuitive but once you try it you'll see. For example, if someone says, \"Oh, Vegans are sick. You can't be healthy and eat like that!\" You could reply, \"I can see why you would feel that way.\" Or, \"Yeah, I'm dying right now. I'm so sick.\" Or, \"You're right! I can see how you know know a lot about health and nutrition from your super big gulp and super-sized burger and fries.\"\n\nIf this seems odd or awkward, practice it with a friend. Have them insult you in every way they can. Within minutes you'll find the key to never feel attacked from an insult ever again... In your entire life! \n\nNext, is you want people to ask questions or to express their doubt. That is the PERFECT learning opportunity. Those who most strongly disagree with often be the last to say anything. So, remember, questions are your friend. Teach them, dispel the myths and answer the questions. For many, the fact that they are asking questions means they trust you. If what they say is stated as cold hard \"facts\" then they don't. But even those people will often come around. \n\nSo, to them, do more fogging. Say something like,\n\n\"Yeah, there are a lot of odd beliefs about being Vegan.\"\n\"Yeah, eating just french fries can technically be Vegan and there are some people don't learn proper nutrition even when they are trying to be more healthy.\"\n\"I can see why you would say that.\"\n\"I'm sure your religion has lots to say about eating meat.\" \n\"You are right! I am '[repeat exactly word-for-word what they just said.\" \n\nIts best that after you do this just smile. Like there is a joke that you are getting but they are not. Its great to see the wheels churning. Those who catch on will stop and the rest will foolishly muddle on. But, once again, its never hard to get them engaged and to teach them.",

So your argument is negatively biased towards your possible dislike of marijuana? I'm guessing. \n\nMaybe if you were open to how much it helps people with illnesses or symptoms ranging from anxiety to pain you might feel better about being more informed on the topic, before jumping to opinions.\n\nI am a happy vegan, working, mother, smoker. I can clear up any misconceptions you might have if you would like some first hand knowledge from a real, good, 'normal' person. \n\nOther than that, being vegan and smoking marihuana aren't related, Ovcourse except if your craving some hearty vegan food after smoking a bowl. I think this blog is great!",

Your analysis makes a lot of sense, AND makes me think this - \n\nif the mother was eating meat and then producing milk, that milk would almost certainly not be eligible to be called vegan.  A vegan mother's milk would be much more vegan.  \n\n(That last bit seems redundant, but oh well.)",

For example, I don't think killing an animal in a way that causes no suffering would be justifiable.\n\nI do. But because animals are sentient, killing them without causing suffering is impossible. Even if you can kill an animal with minimal pain you are still causing the suffering of depriving it of its sentience. So no matter how painlessly you kill, suffering and diminishing suffering is still the moral question on which the issue hangs its hat. I know we're having a very meta intra-vegan argument at this point, but this seems the very foundation of the issue.\n\n&gt;I read that as equivalent to \"If you don't believe something, why act on that belief?\". Did I get that wrong? Why should one feel compelled to act on a belief they don't hold?\n\nThe key words were \"on an individual level\". On one hand you are saying nothing short of complete abolition is justifiable, and on the other you are taking action short of that, on an individual level. Either you agree that merely reducing suffering is good, or your behavior is not justifiable.\n\n&gt;I have already pointed out that I don't see it as a matter of reducing suffering.\n\nI have pointed out that since killing and suffering are inextricable, the issue of killing without suffering is moot. In other words, I can't see how it can be framed as a moral issue outside of the suffering issue, and by your actions if not your words, it strikes me that you must also subscribe to that fact.",

Many people who genuinely care about the environment simply don't know how destructive animal agriculture is, I absolutely didn't. Seeing how bad animal agriculture is on the environment is one of the primary reasons I went vegan. If everyone cut down their meat consumption even by 5-10%, it would make a massive difference and I think many people would be willing to if they knew how destructive their dietary decisions are. Education can never be bad, and I'm really glad a channel like bite size vegan exists.",

I used a piping bag to do just the drips on the outside and then poured the chocolate on top to fill the middle. It honestly turned out bad compared to other people's. And my coconut cream frosting started to melt because of the heat from the chocolate so it was a struggle. But thank you I have been practicing.",

You maybe convert a few likeminded people who in turn become fellow hard liners and alienate even more people away from wanting to consider veganism?\n\nYou aren't getting anyone to jump in your car looking like that.\n\nI dont care about being right.

I feel terrible when I eat meat or dairy, and don't do well with acidic food either (FYI meat is acidic, so that might be why you feel worse on it). \n\nI have spent a lot of time trying to find the best vegan substitutes available in Chicago. The easiest place to find them in Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's has them too. I know Jewel has some organic/vegan food, but my local one is more expensive for this type of food than WF for some reason. I would recommend going slowly and gradually making substitutes like other people mentioned.\n\nHere are some substitutes I like, many of these are Chicago/Midwest companies:\n\n* Meat: Upton's Naturals Seitan (different flavors of fake meat, but they all taste amazing)\n* Butter: Earth Balance - original flavor\n* Milk: So Delicious Coconut Milk\n* Coffee Creamer: So Delicious Coconut Creamer\n* Cheese for melting: Teese and Daiya\n* Raw cheese slices: Still deciding what I like best\n* Cream cheese: Tofutti Better Than Cream Cheese\n* Cheese dip/spread: Wayfare We Can't Say It's Cheese\n* Mayo: Veganese (original or grapeseed kind)\n\nAlso, I just read from my local library Skinny Bitch Book of Vegan Swaps. They have tons more substitutions and where to buy them. And if you are ever in Lakeview, go to Chicago Diner (a vegan place). It will blow your mind, plus they sell their own cookbook :)",

        "comment": "OP, a whole foods plant based diet can help you with both your obesity issue and with type 2 diabetes. \n\nWhen compared to vegetarians, pescetarians, and omnivores, vegans are the only ones who average a normal BMI. Every other group is overweight on average. \n\n\nA plant-based diet may reverse type 2 diabetes. If your on medications to lower blood sugar or blood pressure, you want to make these healthy changes under medical supervision, otherwise your blood sugar or blood pressure may drop too low. \n\nMy reccommendation: \n\nCheck out nutritionfacts.org. watch the videos that are tagged with the conditions and concerns that are relevant to you (and the introductory video as well). \n\nI personally enjoy many of the recipes in the 'how not to die cookbook', and a lot of them are quite easy. I got a used copy online for like 11 dollars too. You may want to check it out. \n\n\nYou can do it both for your own well-being and the well-being of the animals. I wish you luck in doing so :-)",

Here's the catch though, we had to sit through a large number of philosophy classes that the head lion taught. Basically what we learned came down to this: lions eat meat, everything should eat meat. Pig and I went back to the USA and now we can't be vegan anymore because the lions taught us how to live our lives.\n\nThat's what happens when a vegan gets on a deserted island with a pig.",

Then you can smack them out of the water and get the beyond beef or impossible beef overly brown it and add to pasta before you add your cheez other then this dish there is only one other dish that always brings me home and that’s rice gravy and green beans and beyond meat (beyond meat not necessary but common they won’t mind it)\n\nGravy can be a mushroom gravy or sprouts seller a vegan gravy as well then just cook your rice brown your beyond the gravy gets added to the beyond aswell as the green beans and that mix is topped on the rice it’s amazing sorry for the long post \n\nAlso no one ever thinks of it but a oven roasted pan of broccoli and other mixed veggies is probably the most gut soothing thing I have ever had anyone had I just marinate in coco aminos for an hour before clocking but the time frame isn’t important if you drizzle a little prior to cooking it should be just fine",

You bringing a cat indoors doesn't change much. It wasn't your cat's choice to live with you, so don't imagine that you have anything close to a valid argument there.\n\nCats are apex predators and carnivores. They **require** a percentage of protein in their diet in order to subsist. I've not heard of anyone stupid enough to feed their domesticated cats a non-meat diet, perhaps they attribute their cats short lifespans to other factors. There are potentially supplements that could provide their nutrients, but that's about as cruel as asking a human to subsist on cardboard + vitamin pills.\n\nI don't know much about malnutrition in domestic cats, but I do know that it's a big problem with big cats that are illegally owned by people who have no idea how to look after them. The fucktards who own them, often for private zoos, idiots who wanted a \"big pet\" (but had no idea how big a 400lb tiger is, or how much food it takes to sustain one), sometimes decide to feed them dog food - and despite eating as much of that as they want, they eventually die of starvation.\n\nIf you want a vegetarian pet, get a dog.",

(Even \"just mayo\" wouldn't appeal that much to the consumer without beta caroten, which is one of the things you can't have in a mayonaise, according to the rules.)   \n  \nLike i said in another conversation, those rules aren't there to torture animals, or support big lobbies, they're here to protect the consumers.  \nGiving this a pass because it's vegan would also mean giving a pass for anything else because there would be no reason to deny them anymore.  \n  \nI don't doubt Hampton Creek acts in good faith, but the decision still makes sense.",

        "comment": "Tofu is not processed in any way that is harmful, so much so that even WFPB people make an exception for it. It is incredibly nutritious and you should strongly consider continuing to eat it. \n\nFor other protein sources, make sure to pack in protein rich greens and other vegetables where you can. Know which ones have more or less protein per calorie (they do vary quite a bit). Spinach has as much protein per calorie as meats, and more than legumes. It’s just a matter of how much you can eat. Cook it in a pan so it shrivels up and spice it however you like - you can eat at least one carton per meal this way. You can also buy unflavored protein powder and mix it into various things - sauces, smoothies, etc. Try to think of it as a general high protein diet rather than a diet with a high protein food in it. Little things add up. \n\nWhile one egg per day is generally considered inconsequential, be aware that it has not yet been well established whether dietary cholesterol is bad for you, and it is still an active area of research. Anyone who claims otherwise likely has an agenda (yes, youtubers included). Additionally, most major health organizations in the world still recommend limiting or minimizing dietary cholesterol. By all means make an appointment with a dietitian and ask them as well. I have a lecture series on nutrition which addresses cholesterol (among many other things) as well if you’d like (it’s a university course though so it does have a bit of chemistry in it and is about 40 hours worth of material). \n\nIf egg protein is what you’re after, consider eating just the egg white - it has all of the protein and none of the cholesterol. Also ask on r/plantbaseddiet. \n\nTry making other substitutions as well. For example, Silk now has a high-protein milk. Swap your regular morning milk for that. Find an alternative to your morning cereal that has a few extra grams. For example, I eat granola in the morning that has extra protein (20g) in it, which beats most cereals. You can buy pasta that has extra protein in it. There are also high-protein breads and wraps. Try putting less oil on your food (since calories are your limiting factor), eating less starchy veg that are low in protein, and so on.\n\nLastly, out of respect for others, if you’re asking a question related to a non-vegan diet, please consider asking elsewhere. \n\nGood luck 😉",

So yeah, your “silly little example” misfired there and I’m already questioning your beliefs.\n\nNot to mention I looked through your post history and yikes, you support the orange man.\n\nIf you want to know my personal baseline though, i believe that minorities of all kinds (race, sex, gender, sexual identity, etc) deserve the same rights as those that hold majority status (or in the case of sex where women tend to outnumber men, women deserve equal rights to men).\n\nIt’s also important to not be “colorblind” or any equivalent because with things like Affirmative Action, racial equality has only “really existed” for 50-60 years and still isn’t there yet, so we have these minorities that still don’t have the same opportunities as majorities and we need to keep that in consideration.\n\nI mean as a white woman statistically I benefited more from affirmative action than racial minorities, but I leave this discussion here considering we’re on a vegan subreddit.",

All cheese is inherently vegetarian-friendly so for this company to market \"cheddar style singles\" sounded more like dairy-free vegan \"cheese\" to me. The other element here is the fact that I found this in a Safeway in the soy section next to Daiya, Chao, Field Roast, tofu, and other vegan-friendly soy products. So ultimately the labeling and the product's location lead me to feel confident enough to buy it without reading the ingredients more closely.",

I have never witnessed anyone in my offline life ridicule or make fun of a vegan for being a vegan.  I think animals and animal life's are very important and would not pick on anyone who is trying to live a vegan life. So as for being picked on just for being vegan I think it's a stretch for actions that are out of the norm considering animals and your dietary choices being brought up in conversation where not needed I can agree vegans are picked on online from my experience online and offline.

        "comment": "*shrugs* Sometimes it all comes down to planning. I have access to a store with some awesome vegan branded products. I go there once per month and stock up on things like dried soybean chicken... less than $4 per bag and lasts me and the husband over 4 meals. We have to drive for 35-40 minutes to get there, but once per month it is worth it. \n\nI try to make sure there is always some leftovers laying about that I can microwave if I need it. And if I eat out I go for a salad or plain vegetables with no butter, and perhaps a side of chips and a bag of peanuts. You gotta be inventive. :D",

I'm not judging anybodys drug usage, just highlighting how its fairly irrelevant in assessing somebody's true character, same goes for somebody's diet or religion etc.\nAll im trying to say is i disagree with this sentiment I keep seeing whereby all meat eaters are murderers and therefore bad people, I'm a vegan therefore I'm not a  murderer and a good person. I just don't think its convincing anybody outside the choir and really just doesn't highlight any positivity around veganism.",

        "comment": "You are absolutely right that modern Christianity has corrupted the message of God in regards to eating animals for food. Many believers were taught that the bible is \"inerrant\" and that the message has been preserved over all these centuries, but after some digging and reading other historical sources, that's simply not true at all. Turns out, the early Christians abstained from eating animal flesh, and they believed in living in peace with the earth and all living beings. That's God's nature--love and peace. The manuscripts were edited  to include false, man-made doctrines like: God permitting and finding pleasure in eating animal flesh/animal sacrifices, that Jesus fed multitudes with 5 loaves and 2 *fish*, tithing, hell, women cannot be in leadership, God is in control, God is angry at the world and causing the turmoil we see in the earth... There are many more. I believed all those lies until I started studying the bible on my own, with multiple translations, and multiple historical sources to see what messages were truly preserved from the 1st and 2nd centuries, if any. Found out the book of Jude and 2 Peter weren't authored by who claims to author them, shouldn't even be in the bible. Many writings were simply removed from the canon because they didn't fit what the leaders in authority believed or wanted at the time. Jerome, Augustine and Constantine were responsible for adding/editing/deleting/mistranslating some of the most vile doctrines that are found in our bibles. \n\nI just tried talking with my super religious family about going vegan (I started for health reasons, then saw some documentaries which brought me to tears of compassion and remorse, then started digging in the bible and it *all* lines up perfectly to be vegan) and boy, you would have thought I told them eating poison 3 times a day is good for your health. It was a very volatile \"discussion\" which showed how deeply ingrained and imprisoned religion had made them. \n\nIt's a sad reality, but I won't stop sharing the truth, even if it means I lose everyone who is/was close to me and doing this completely alone, mocked, and  ridiculed. The truth sets us free.",

In that thread on the couple that killed their baby someone said (and I'm paraphrasing), \"it's hard to find objective writing on the health benefits of veganism.\" I [brought up several scientific articles](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ggzur/your_baby_isnt_vegan_stop_it/c1ni4gt).\n\nI got downvoted pretty quickly but some people started upvoting me though I suspect they were all /r/vegan members (thanks guys!). Point is, just link some solid evidence and make rational arguments. Eventually it will win people over.\n\nNinja edit: BTW sorry for linking to that comment yet again.

They read the theorist Levinas, who talks about the limitless moral obligations that come upon us when encountering another face. Noting how Levinas, despite holding this position and using it as the basis for an expansive ethical theory, seemed fine with affirming the ongoing explusions of Palestinians in Israel, Butler makes the point that 'who counts as having a face' should not be taken for granted, and that this is a key issue structuring any ethical framework. Going from that, it seems that the big problem here is that animals often aren't seen as having faces that assert ethical demands upon us - as exemplified by the case of Philosophy Tube and Contrapoints. So much of vegan outreach and activism, drawing on a whole arguments that I may agree with to varying degrees, can be summed up as an assertion that they do. Until animals have faces to someone, the question of the ethical implication of their lives on ours is basically impossible to think about.",

Unless the vendor explicitly allows it, or someone jailbreaks a specific hardware vendor for flashing custom firmware, the default behavior I am aware of is like this.  The only EVSE I know for sure is able to use alternate software is OpenEVSE, because OpenEVSE is an open source project designed specifically for this purpose... and it's also usually found in home use rather than public, though there is nothing explicitly stopping it from being used in commercial applications as long as the open source license is complied with.",

Most home loans are on an 80/20 split. \n\nSolar comes with a 30% tax credit. So you pay the extra 20% down, take the 30% tax credit, pocket the 10%, and have the energy savings pay off the loan.\n\nIf you tell me your loan term, general location, and effective electric rate, I can give you a quick idea on if your loan payments would be less than your annual savings.",

A replacement battery will cost me around $6000, and should have twice the energy capacity of the first one.\n\nSo, if we figure that I have to replace my battery at 90,000 miles, at $6000, and I'll get another 90,000 miles out of the replacement, before the rest of the car is so old I am not interested in replacing the battery again, I'll get 180,000 miles out of that $6000 price-tag.  That's what? 3¢ per mile, right?  The electricity I consume is sold to me at 12¢ per kilowatt-hour, and I get 4 miles per kilowatt-hour, so... another 3¢ per mile for the electricity.\n\nGasoline, on the other hand, costs about $2 per gallon right now, and fluctuates up to about $2.50 per gallon.  I might get, oh, 35 miles to the gallon in a small economy car, or 20 miles per gallon in a small sports car.  Let's use 25 miles per gallon as a compromise.  At $2 for 25 miles, I'm spending 8¢ per mile on the gasoline alone.  Add to that oil changes every 3000 miles and other internal combustion engine repairs that have to be done over 180,000 miles, and we have a cost of actually driving the car that's about twice what I'm spending on my electric car.\n\nSure, the electric cars are a bit more expensive to build and buy.  Even if we include cost of the original battery at $270/kwh ($6480), it only moves my cost to about 9¢ per kilowatt-hour even considering the consumption of the battery over the life of the vehicle.\n\nAnd, of course, we are not buying electric cars *because they are cheaper*.  Does one buy a $50,000 pickup truck because it's cheaper?  or a $70,000 sports car?  Or a $90,000 luxury car? Nope.  It's not about how cheap it is - it's about other things, like reliability and utility.\n\nUnderstand that I don't own an electric car to \"save the world from carbon dioxide.\"  I don't even think that carbon dioxide is a big problem. But, I *really like my electric car*.",

        "comment": "&gt; Including the adapter on the station would require retrofitting all the stations though\n\nI don't think they would, replace the hanger with a hanger that is also a CCS1 adapter. By using the button on the NACS plug it will release from the magic dock, use the button/latch on the CCS1 magic dock it will release the whole holder from the station. Once the cable is removed from the magic dock it will release from the station, and once the magic dock is released from the station it won't let go of the NACS plug. \n\nHaving said all that I don't see why a 3rd party NACS to CCS1 adapter wouldn't hurt to have if something goes wrong with the magic dock or Tesla only puts it on 1/4 the stations (so Tesla owners get priority to some stations for a while). \n\nTesla may scrap the magic dock idea though and just sell an adapter like they do for CCS1-&gt;NACS. CCS spec allows (or did 2 years ago) for 1st party (Tesla or CCS stations) to sell adapters so technically that 3rd party will be against spec, but so is T-&gt;J1772 and that doesn't stop anyone.\n\nNOTE: I use NACS here as shortcut for \"physical T using CCS protocol\". Although CCS protocol is not guaranteed I don't see why it wouldn't use it.",

It is incumbent upon the party proposing an action (e.g., a carbon tax) to demonstrate that the action will not have severe economic consequences, especially in terms of the effect upon the poor.  It is generally acknowledged that a straight carbon tax will be hugely regressive.\n\n&gt;At the cost of money now (yes, present value is greater than future value) we can prevent potential disaster...\n\nDo you suppose the cost of prevention is cheaper than the cost of adaptation?\n\nMoreover, human impacts on climate are far greater than simple CO2 emissions.  There are methane emissions, both from livestock and gas well leaks, land use changes, CFCs, black carbon, etc.  A highly costly measure such as a carbon tax will address few of those, meaning it is destined to prevent much of anything, even assuming human impact actually could result in \"potential disaster.\"\n\n&gt;If warming was found not to be attributed to mankind, wouldn't it still make sense to reduce our impact and emissions in order to lengthen our time on the planet?\n\nMaybe you could explain what you mean by \"lengthen our time on the planet.\"  The relative lifetime of fossil fuels compared to humans' residence on this planet will be a blip, whether there is a carbon tax or not.  The longevity of humanity will depend far more on nuclear power (and some renewables) than on fossil fuels.\n\nIf you would really like to see a major reduction in human impact on the climate, I strongly urge you to do the following:\n\n- Petition mightily to divert every last penny of climate research money to Molten Salt Reactor R&amp;D.\n\n- Whenever people claim they are concerned about the climate, but are opposed to nuclear power, punch them in the head as hard as you can.\n\n- Recognize that fossil fuels are self-taxing because we use the best resources first, and they are a finite resource.  For example, oil has quadrupled in price over the last decade or so.  Natural gas will follow suit, followed by coal.\n\n- Promote electrification of transportation.  EVs are one option, but much better options include PRT systems such as SkyTran or even electrified roads that power light electric cars via induction.\n\n- Do all you can to promote rapid economic development in currently developing countries.  Fertility rates [fall rapidly](http://www.indexmundi.com/g/correlation.aspx?v1=67&amp;v2=31&amp;y=2006) as GDP per capita increases.",

Why carry (and pay for) around a large battery which offers 200-300 miles or so (this seems to be the range most people keep talking about), when most people will never go that far?\n\nI think 150 miles or so is the sweet spot, if you really need to travel, then rent a car/van, or as most of us are doing, keep the EV as a 2nd car, while still owning a gasser for hauling/long distance.",

Generally, that's been with Track Mode turn on, but I don't think I've seen any reports either way with the new Track Mode V2, which might improve things. \n\nThere's no question that the Model 3 is better than the Model S in this respect, especially if you turn on Track Mode to get the cooling system in front of the heat soak. But, at least from what I've seen so far, it's not as robust as a Porsche. I'm not knocking the Tesla, because while it's Tesla's sportiest car on sale at the moment, it's not a sports car like a Porsche is, and (in the case of my Model 3P and the 911 Turbo S I traded in on it) it costs ⅓ as much. As I tell everyone who asks, my Model 3 is not as good as my 911 was, but it is ***WAY*** closer than you'd expect, given the price difference, in terms of performance, comfort, and practicality. And the build quality, while not close to Porsche and, to be honest, below what you'd expect for a car of this type and certainly at this price, isn't so bad that it takes away from the driving or overall ownership experiences.",

        "comment": "Fair enough. Tesla has undoubtedly addressed many of the pain points. \n\nThe number of plugs at SC sites vs CCS plugs at non-Tesla sites isn't very relevant (aside from the reliability issues) given the number of Tesla vs all other brands. If CCS models and sales catch up to Tesla, no doubt CCS networks will respond to the demand. Right now, plug utilization at CCS sites is no doubt far less than at SC sites due to fewer CCS cars on the roads. So, whether there are 2 or 20 idle plugs at a site isn't all that meaningful if you are able to get a charge. Granted, reliability challenges mean a greater likelihood of being stranded at lower density CCS sites.\n\nReliability is definitely improving at CCS sites. EVGo once had a poor reputation and has done a good job of correcting issues. EA is replacing HW that is unreliable, so improvements are certain. By next summer, I expect EA reliability to be mostly resolved.\n\nPayment methods, multiple apps\\\\RFID cards, pricing, definitely a problem with CCS. WRT pricing, he goes into the price he paid for EA with the Taycan, $1 + $.89. those were standard, not Pass + rates. Am I wrong to assume Tesla also uses /min pricing in states that don't allow /kWh? That is a state regulation problem, not network operators.\n\nTo be fair, Pass+ members would pay less, and with /kWh pricing now in many states, not too much more than SC ($.03/kWh difference in my state). Yes, the disparate networks and accounts is a hot mess, something Plug &amp; Charge may be able to resolve? Most networks claimed 2020 was the expected time for P&amp;C rollouts, hopefully this will go a long way towards solving these issues. \n\nPricing, well that is something else. I suspect regulation may be needed to address pricing, I would rather see free markets address it, but until competition is real, pricing without regulation may be elusive. Maybe state utility commissions could step in with price relief for charge point operators, giving some relief for the demand charges perhaps?\n\nCCS networks and the protocol itself have been behind Tesla by a number of years, but progress is rapid. If you honestly did this \"study\" every year, within 1-2 years I suspect the differences would be minimal. That is good for everyone as Tesla owners also rely on other networks from time to time. The good news is the growth in the charging infrastructure. In 2 years, it has improved vastly, albeit not without bumps in the road. Give it two more and it should be smooth sailing.",

        "comment": "If someone has consistent L2 charging for 8+ hours per day at home or work then they don’t need to recoup the 10 miles they drive to a restaurant while they eat. Most people would only even need to L2 charge at work a couple of days each week. \n\nI’m not saying opportunity charging should go away, just that it would be much more useful at 40-50kW instead of 6kW. Then you could get a 50% charge in 45 minutes and you’ve actually **gained** something by grocery shopping and charging at the same time. \n\nWe could push for more 10-11kW AC chargers but not all cars can take advantage. The base Model 3 for instance maxes out at 7.6kW on AC charging. \n\nI stayed in an area for vacation last week where my options were a local 6kW charger or a DC fast charger ~30 minutes away. \n\nSo I could stop for an hour by this charger each day, hope it was unoccupied, and gain about 8% while eating dinner or something, which would normally have not been enough to recover what I had lost driving around that day. \n\nAfter two days of waiting for extra time after dinner for the car to charge a bit more, I skipped it, waited until I was low on charge, and went over to the DC fast charger. A 45min charge was enough for the rest of the week. \n\nI’m glad the 6kW charger is there, but I think most people will prefer home, work, or “weekly gas station” style charging over trickle charging every time they find a 6kW charger.",

        "comment": "They weren't given.  BMW asked for help validating a drivetrain for 2 years, by road testing the drivetrain in an existing design, filling out surveys, and get the car checked out by BMW techs on a regular basis.\n\nIt was always BMW's property, and it was pretty clear from the beginning that BMW gets the car back at the end of the contract and that you couldn't get it back.\n\nYou can't expect BMW to be able to service a vehicle which had such a small 'production run', and that's ignoring the liability issues.  It sucks that some got crushed (&lt;sarcasm&gt;maybe they were learning how to dispose of EVs properly?&lt;/sarcasm&gt;), but looks like a bunch of them have a 2nd life.\n\nThis is all IMHO of course, but based on logic and facts as well as I know them.",

        "comment": "Meanwhile... Tesla claims they don't pay for advertising.  \n\nWhat do we call the billions upon billions of dollars in bonuses that Elon Musk was paid in the form of stock options... of which he's extracted billions of dollars in value from to fund ~~idiotic~~ erhrrmm... other ventures.  🤐  What other CEO has ever seen pay like that?\n\nDude's gotta be the most expensive ~~stock pumping 🤡~~ advertising agency in the world.  He certainly does the job... getting non-stop coverage on the internet with non-stop articles, non-stop youtube videos, non-stop tweets (I mean he bought twitter), and then non-stop coverage in EV discussion.  \n\n... Although, I'm less convinced it's due to his stellar personality or because he says controversial things... and more to do with the hyperinflated company stock price.  Let me reiterate...Tesla is worth more than every major OEM combined, while having only sold 4.4 million cars **total globally** over the last 11 years.   That's about half of one percent of the world's total vehicle sales.\n\n(Of course... as we know... Musk has used tax avoidance loopholes / near 0% interest loan shenanigans by collateralizing all his Tesla pay (stock and options) to get huge sums of cash that he then used to buy Tesla stock and lock up more shares at retail prices while active traded share volume was low... thus pumping share value and opening up new bonus tranches for himself...which he used to rinse and repeat all of the above, constantly pumping the stock higher, and it's known that he wasn't the only Tesla shareholder using this hyper leveraged style of trading to pump the stock)\n\nMeanwhile, I've been doing the math for years now, and attempting to educate people that Musk's company and lauded long range BEV technology is setting back the world's fossil fuel and emissions reduction by potentially decades (the longer it goes on), and has only been **financially** successful (not environmentally successful) through unprecedented domestic and international government subsidies + subsidization from their direct competitors (as a result of government tradable emissions credit regulation).  These are all funds that, unlike government loans to struggling established automakers that employ millions of people during economic catastrophes... never have to paid back... all to support and promote subpar products when the end goal is emissions reduction.\n\nThe real irony is that I don't think Elon Musk is a master advertiser.  He's a master baiter/distractor... because I think our government is using him to distract from the fact that they're slowing down the transition away from fossil fuels.  For good reason too.  Oil companies have some of the most effective lobbyists across the world and still have unextracted assets in the ground that are easily worth trillions of dollars.  Does anyone think they're just standing by and allowing those to become trillions in stranded assets?\n\nElon Musk is the clown that big oil and government counts on to distract all of us.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm over here replacing my 28 mile car commute with a 600 MPGe electric unicycle.  I sure would love a bike lane.  Can a guy please not get murdered by a car on the road because government doesn't want to support actual sustainable forms of transit?",

Hang in there.\n\n&gt; my dad asserted that no intelligent people are vegetarian, that it's just a cult and I only do it to be sanctimonious.\n\nNormally I don't like appealing to authority, but ask your dad how unintelligent does he think these vegetarians were:\n\n* Einstein\n\n*\"So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It always seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore.\"*\n\n*\"I have always eaten animal flesh with a somewhat guilty conscience.\"*\n\n* Leonardo Da Vinci\n\n*\"The mere idea of permitting the existence of unnecessary suffering, still more that of taking life, was abhorrent to him. Vasari tells, as an instance of his love of animals, how when in Florence he passed places where birds were sold he would frequently take them from their cages with his own hand, and having paid the sellers the price that was asked would let them fly away in the air, thus giving them back their liberty.\"* \n\n*\"That this horror of inflicting pain was such as to lead him to be a vegetarian is to be inferred from a reference which occurs in a letter sent by Andrea Corsali to Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici, in which, after telling him of an Indian race called Gujerats who neither eat anything that contains blood nor permit any injury to any living creature, he adds ‘like our Leonardo da Vinci.\"*\n\n* Socrates\n\n*\"Would this habit of eating animals not require that we slaughter animals that we knew as individuals, and in whose eyes we could gaze and see ourselves reflected, only a few hours before our meal?\"*\n\n* Pythagoras\n\n*\"As long as man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings he will never know health or peace. For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seed of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love.\"*\n\n* Tesla\n\n*\"vegetarianism is a commendable departure from the established barbarious habit. That we can subsist on plant food and perform our work even to advantage is not a theory, but a well-demonstrated fact.\"*\n\n* George Bernard Shaw\n\n(On being asked why he was a vegetarian:)\n\n*\"Oh, come! That boot is on the other leg. Why should you call me to account for eating decently? If I battened on the scorched corpses of animals, you might well ask me why I did that.\"*\n\n* Gandhi\n\n*\"I hold today the same opinion as I held then. To my mind, the life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being. I should be unwilling to take the life of a lamb for the sake of the human body.\"*\n\n*\"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.\"*\n\n* Leo Tolstoy\n\n*\"The wrongfulness, the immorality of eating animal food has been recognized by all mankind during all the conscious life of humanity. Why, then have people generally not come to acknowledge this law? The answer is that the moral progress of humanity is always slow.\"*\n\n* Kafka\n\n*\"Now I can look at you in peace; I don`t eat you any more.\"*\n\n* Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n*\"You have just dined, and however scrupulously the slaughter-house is concealed in the graceful distance of miles, there is complicity...\"*\n\n\n\n* Isaac Singer (Nobel Laureate)\n\n*\"People often say that humans have always eaten animals, as if this is a justification for continuing the practice. According to this logic, we should not try to prevent people from murdering other people, since this has also been done since the earliest of times.\"*",

        "comment": "&gt;Also on PlugShare most charging stations are universal in the sense that as long as there's no tesla logo I can use any charger on the map?\n\nIn plugshare, filter for EV Plug (J1772), and CCS DCFC (SAE Combo). Those are the 2 connectors the bolt has. J1772 is regular Level 2 charging that gets you an empty-to-full charge in about 9.5 hours (some stations will be slower than this, but most J1772s give you that speed), and CCS is DC Fast Charging that gets you an 80% charge in about an hour. Note that CCS stations are less widespread, more likely to cost money, more expensive on average than paid J1772 stations, and less likely to take credit cards--but they give you a hell of a fast charge.\n\nLook at the stations in your area, namely DC fast stations. You might want to get accounts with a couple of the more major networks. I strongly suggest at least downloading the phone apps and setting up accounts/putting credit cards on file with 1) ChargePoint, 2) GreenLots, and 3) Flo.\n\n&gt;And if, say, I plug it into a 110v every night from 6pm to 8am then do one full charge at a charging station a week would that keep most batteries full? Obv. depending on my mileage but give or take?\n\nA full charge will give you about 400km in the summer (a bit less highway driving, a bit more city driving, but that's a pretty good ballpark) and probably about 300km in a BC winter. 14 hours of 110V charging each night, assuming you have an outlet that can handle a full 12A draw, by my estimate will give you about 120km in the summer and 80km in the winter, roughly 25-30% of a full charge. If you drive less than that each day, you don't even need the weekly full charge since the nightly 110V will cover all your driving. On the flipside if you drive a lot, this L1 nightly+L2 weekly will get you a maximum of about 180km a day of summer driving or 130km a day of winter driving. These are really ballpark numbers so YMMV, but I'm trying to be as accurate as possible.",

Getting an EV down to that weight is not happening any time in the foreseeable future. Being heavy means worse cornering, worse response to changing direction, etc. Tesla apparently intends to address this in their 2020 Roadster with crazy expensive tires (Michelin Pilot Sport Cups), but a more affordable one that handles well is still going to be a challenge.",

How I know about it, is having been reported in an interview with VW design team near the launch. Sadly don't remember any more. However journalist exactly asked about \"Well unlike some other cars, ID.3 doesn't have frunk. Why so? Technical limitations? Design choice? Surely it isn't accidental.\" Something like that.\n\nAnd then the good journalist let the design team member speak. He went on exactly how it went. For example, apparently *there was an VW internal design body mock up of ID.3. **with a frunk***. So not like they didn't know the idea existed. However the design concept with increased turning radius and maximized cabin volume (which of course then includes the cargo volume increase possibility on a collapsing rear seat car) won over in consideration.\n\nSimply ~we thought customers would appreciate the turning radius more and frunk doesn't even buy that much room compared to what putting it in would have eaten from the cabin space~.\n\nBut yeah, not as easy to make video. However I think someone did one. Demonstrating turning circles of various EVs on parking lot. As I remember main focus was the ID.3 and another EV with good turning radius, the Honda E. Then compared bigger EVs with worse turning radius.\n\nBut yeah. Not as simple as noting in 5 minute design walk around \"the dumbos didn't even manage to put frunk in\".",

Its about even with hybrids currently or will be shortly.\n\nHopefully battery production catches up.  There literally aren’t enough mines refineries and manufacturing plants for batteries to keep up with the rest of ev manufacturing.  \n\nIt takes time and a lot of investment.  From a business stand point theres still a big risk in investing too heavily in lithium battery production.  A new battery chemistry would make all of your investment worthless before you finish building.  Its also not impossible that once all the ev enthusiast get theirs that demand will decline like it did with hybrids.  I like my phev, but most people dont really care.  I work in tech, a lot of people around me are into evs too.  Most  people wont pay $1k more for a hybrid version of the vehicle they are buying.  If you live in a city in California it probably looks a lot different.",

Right now this equation don't hold up because EVs are much more expensive up-front, but they will come down to the same price faster than there will be *both* same up-front cost and 500+ miles range. So, and that point in time, you will have to ask yourself if you would stick to an ICE when you can have a BEV with ~300 miles range at the same up-front cost.",

And aside from the battery, an EV is an incredibly simple machine (basically 1 moving part) that should be much cheaper than a regular car with economies of scale. The Volt (not an EV but a hybrid, btw), is overpriced mostly because of all the engineering that went into meshing the EV system with an ICE, not just because of the battery.\n\n&gt;all because of AGW alarmism\n\nI bought an EV (Nissan Leaf), and it had nothing to do with AGW. I bought it because it only cost $22k and I can drive 160 miles for the price of a gallon of gas. And none of the money I spend on electricity gets sent out of the country to the likes of Saudi Arabia.

Things like R&D are not accounted for at gross level while other auto makers do\n- Traditional automakers take a hit at gross due to dealership model\n\nAs far as Tesla margins, both have been steadily declining for multiple quarters and they buildup of inventory is an indicator that they are not done chopping incentives & lowering margins.\n\nRegardless, all these Tesla clowns thinking big auto can't compete are living in la-la land.\n\nLong term, Tesla is NOT in a good spot.  They've cut even the most basic features out of the car to save money, cut corners on build quality, and have not expanded service enough to provide quality support to owners.  \n\nWhile early adopters MAY have been OK with poor service, mass market consumers will not.  \n\nEV market, in general, is not in a great spot as adoption is SLOWER than anticipated.  Consumer surveys indicate that large portions of population DO NOT want to go EV yet.\n\nI personally have owned 3 Teslas and will NOT buy another unless they bring back features and fix service.  It just isn't worth it.  Probably buying a Lyriq next, but waiting for the ridiculous prices to settle a bit.",

My purchase criteria was very simple: Without making any allowances for the way it was powered, did I like it as a car? The answer was not only yes, but hell yes. I had tested a couple EVs before the days of lithium-ion batteries and had passed on them. The Think kinda-sorta blew me away relative to what I had feared it might be. It was a lot more fun to drive than I expected. And for the price, I'd have been a moron *not* to get one.\n\nI don't think I'd want to spend, say, 20 miles driving to and from work every day in it. But guess what? I'm retired, so I don't. For short trips -- five miles here, two miles there, 10 miles every now and then, and on rare occasions maybe 30 miles at a stretch -- it's great. It's definitely the best grocery-getter I've ever had, including all my gas cars. I'm constantly amazed at how much crap I can jam into it relative to how small it is. Much, much, much better than a Smart car in that regard.\n\nI might be wrong about availability of new Thinks, but I don't think I am. I believe they've given up the ghost, and that you cannot get a new Think anymore. If you're really interested, I'd try giving Hawthorne Auto a call. If anyone's going to know, they certainly will.",

        "comment": "&gt; Wouldn’t call the Hawaii solution very useful. \n\nIt's *incredibly* \"useful\".\n\nAs long as there have been AC power systems, which goes back to Tesla himself, there has been the need to maintain grid stability.  The basic law is the amount of power being generated must always exactly match the load.  Or bad stuff happens.\n\nSo, again, since Tesla's day, suppliers of electricity to the grid have been modulating their output, fraction of second by fraction of second, to ensure the generation stays balanced to the load.\n\nSolar PVs didn't used to do this, and when there weren't many of them, it was OK, because the output whatever they could, and the utilities continued to adjust their generation so that the load was matched even with the extra output of solar inverters.\n\nNow we're getting to the point where solar PV is becoming a significant contributor to some grids.  And because of this, solar inverters need to play by the same rules of the AC grid that Tesla told us about all those years ago.  Or bad things will happen.\n\nBecause Hawaii has a lot of solar, and weak grids, this had to be solved some years back for Hawaii.  There are rules that inverters need to back off when the grid is oversupplied, and have to hang in there through periods where the grid is undersupplied, to contribute to grid stability, rather than being part of the problem\n\nSo, this will come down to the owner of the solar PV inverter.  Their system has to do the right thing from the grid perspective - or else.   The right thing is reduce their output to the grid when the grid is oversupplied.  Now if they have batteries, they can choose to put that energy into batteries and that is cool, or into the swimming pool or hot tub, anywhere but export to the grid.",

        "comment": "Here's the thing though -- that \"at highway speeds\" criteria that means you're probably in two-motor extended-range mode is *big*.\n\nImagine a thought experiment. Suppose you could collect data from every Volt (or every Gen 1 Volt, see below) about their drive history -- what proportion of the time they were spending in each mode and driving conditions. It seems *entirely* plausible that *most of the time* the fleet has the engine running, the car was at highway speeds and in two-motor mode. It's even more likely that's true if you measure by miles instead of time, and I would assert that it's *almost certain* that at least a very large minority of miles driven fleet-wide are in the two-motor extended-range mode, with the engine mechanically coupled to the wheels.\n\nThis just comes out of the nature of PHEVs -- because your day-to-day driving is likely to be handled mostly if not entirely in EV mode (especially with a moderately long range PHEV like the Volt), if you're on engine power there's a good chance you're on a longer trip.\n\nSo even though only one out of the four modes described in your article mechanically couples engine to wheels, two of those modes aren't very relevant to the conversation and the third is probably less common than the fourth.\n\nBeyond *that*, remember that there are two generations of the Volt, and their drivetrains differ meaningfully on this metric, as discussed in the video I linked. Your article is describing the Gen I Volt (2010-2015), and despite my objection above, that generation really *was* closer to a serial hybrid.\n\nFor the Gen 2 Volt however, it's even *less* true, by a substantial amount. From the video I linked, the Gen 2 Volt has five drive modes, not four:\n\n* One-Motor EV mode. This is pretty close to the Gen 1 Volt, except that per Alex's explanation the two-motor mode can occur at any speed if lots of torque is required.\n* Two-Motor EV mode. Ditto.\n* Low-Range extended mode. Splits engine power (via a planetary gear set) between the wheels and MGA (motor/generator unit A) to generate electricity, which then flows to the battery and/or MGB to power the wheel via another planetary set. (It's not clear whether it's one, the other, both, or depends on driving conditions.)\n* Fixed-Ratio extended mode. The engine's power goes exclusively to the wheels, via planetary. There's a fixed ratio between engine RPM and wheel RPM, however the engine's power can be supplemented by MGB for more torque. MGA is unused in this drive mode.\n* High-Range extended mode. At the level of my description here, this actually is very close to the low-range extended mode, ironically enough, but via a different path. At high vehicle speeds, the fixed-ratio extended mode would have to have the engine operate at too high an RPM for optimal efficiency, so this again decouples the engine and wheel RPMs, splitting engine output through the first planetary set, partially into the wheels and partially into MGA (which then powers MGB and/or the battery).\n\nNote that all three of the extended range modes have the engine delivering some of their power to the wheels entirely mechanically, through the first planetary set. This is reinforced by Alex's statement: \"Perhaps the most important difference between the first generation Voltec system and the second generation Voltec system is that *the second generation Voltec system really does not spend any time in true serial hybrid mode*\" [emph. mine].\n\nCircling back, what this means is that saying \"the Volt is a serial hybrid\" (or even \"*mostly* a serial hybrid\") at *best* has a *huge* caveat for the Gen 1 and is basically entirely false for the Gen 2. I think that justifies my claim that \"The Volt uses electricity as a primary source and gasoline as a secondary source, but only to generate electricity\" is incorrect.",

If you're getting 320 miles of range, what does that involve, 2 charging stops... and not even full charging stops at that?\n\nI mean, you drive 4 hours, stop to charge to 80% for 30 minutes, drive another 3 hours, stop to charge for 10 minutes to 30%, then drive the last hour, getting to your final destination with just above 10% SOC.   Seems like pretty good spacing for bathroom / food breaks.\n\nPeople need to have realistic expectations on what an EV can do.  You want 400 miles of range.  Cool... add another 20 kWh of cells to a single vehicle in a cell supply constrained industry.  They sell those, they're called model S's.  The question is are you willing to pay for the markup?  Are you willing to lug around a larger battery in daily driving when those cells could have been used somewhere else to reduce emissions just so you can take one less bathroom break on a 500+ mile road trip?  Convenience has really distorted our sense of environmental responsibility.\n\nThis is almost like saying... \"I'm willing to do what's right for the environment... so long as it's just as convenient as my gas car.\"\n\nBad way to look at things.  Gas cars are certainly convenient for road trips, but that comes at an environmental cost.  They're also far less convenient in daily driving since you have to constantly go to gas stations, get oil changes, change brake pads, and you can't even pre-heat them in the garage.\n\nThere is a solution though... they're called PHEVs. ;)",

        "comment": "Convince me of what?  That the first-world society should increase the costs of living in order to transfer wealth to developing countries in reparations for some undefined and mostly hypothetical harm we've caused them?  Quite a bit, I expect.\n\nHumans adapt to changing conditions. Thats what we do.  Look at the island that Manhattan sits on. Take a good look at the maps of the Island 150 years ago, and look at them now.  The island has been expanded quite a few times. Not to escape global warming, but because land there is valuable, and by creating more, we've created quite a bit of wealth.\n\nLook at the Falklands or the Maldives. Those are not poor people who are being pushed off their islands by rising tides.  They are rich people who are trying to get even more rich by playing the poor island natives.  They have not lost any land to global warming.  If anything, they've gained square footage of living space in the last 100 years from food and materials that have been shipped to the islands, docks and seawalls that have been built, etc.\n\nIn the next 100 years, seas will rise somewhere in the neighborhood of  25 cm.  Eighteen centimeters of that rise would have happened anyway.  No one is going to have to do ANYTHING to adapt to the remaining seven centimeters of sea level rise.  I mean nothing. Not one damn thing.\n\nIncreased CO2 is known to increase crop yields.  Yes, it takes increased water to realize this, but we have the technology to irrigate, so a bit more water isn't an issue in the industrialized world.  Don't tell me about droughts, or I'll point out that the dust bowl and other massive droughts we've had were before any credible scientists claim man had any meaningful effect on atmospheric water levels.\n\nThe truth is that the warming so far has not been harmful overall.  My contention is that some of that warming was natural anyway.  I know we disagree on that, so there is no reason to open that debate.\n\nWe have so many more pressing problems to combat that are going wanting because of the hysteria surrounding CO2.  We have deforrestation, over-fishing, mercury poisoning, lead poisoning, developing nation populations stripping the vegetation from the land and causing horrible environmental damage through ignorance.  We have children dying from contaminated drinking water because they are so poor and ignorant they don't know they can purify the water easily with things they have at hand.  They die of lung cancer and other lung diseases because they burn wood and/or cow dung in open fires in their one-room homes for warmth and cooking.  It's trivial to build an efficient stove that produces more heat, more efficient burn and a chimney that whisks away the toxic fumes from the fire, but we can't help them because we want to concentrate on forcing people to use florescent god damn light bulbs.\n\nI would absolutely love to see real progress in the world. I'd love to see the poor, dirty, starved areas of the world green with gardens to feed the people there so we don't have to ship them food on huge, diesel burning ships.  I'd love to see clean electric trains whisking people around the country for little money, clean electric cars and motorcycles plying the streets.\n\nWe have so many technological advances that make life better for people, and it seems to me that certain sections of the population want to impede all progress and simply punish the most advanced societies for being the most advanced societies.  They (you, I think) tend to glorify the uneducated, undeveloped, backward, starving, rioting, witch-hunting people of the world and talk about the incredible harm that we're doing to them by destroying their, what did you call it, \"natural capital.\"\n\nThey do a really good job of destroying their natural capital all by themselves.  What we need to do **for them** is to strive to make more efficient items, that raise the quality of life for those who use them, and continue to improve our processes such that we get better at using the resources that we have available to us.  We can then share those life-altering technologies with the developing world.\n\nBy increasing our costs, we restrict our ability to do that. Sure, we could give the developing world more wealth.  We could make it, and give some of it to them.  Then we could make more, and give more to them.  Who profits from this, though?  Would it not be better to take the money and, instead of giving it to someone who didn't earn it, use that money to find better ways of doing things than we are doing now?\n\nYou ask what it would take to convince me to lower the profits of the developed world to pay for non-existant damage we might someday to to the developing world?  I ask you what new technologies, what medical breakthroughs, what life-altering discoveries are you willing to cast aside so that a beachfront owner in a tropical paradise can hire yet another pool boy.  Because, trust me, the money you want to send to the developing nations is not going to the poor of those nations, it's going to the already rich in those nations.\n\nI'm firmly convinced that these trading schemes are not about making the world a better place - they are about syphoning money off of a population that some people feel are too rich, and giving that money to a very few people who really are too rich. All in the name of the climate, of course.",

Leasing can be less upfront but you don’t get tax credits or added home value. Financing might be better long-term if you can swing it. I went with financing and love the lower monthly bills. Plus, it’s awesome knowing the panels are mine! Your call, but I’m happy with my choice.",

In other words, your anecdotal decision is not widely applicable.\n\n&gt;and you'd be pretty crazy to think it's not going to go up more over the next 7 years / 85k miles.\n\nFair point.\n\n&gt;Consider that just for the $50 some ICE drivers pay for an oil change every 3,000 miles, I can buy enough electricity to drive my Leaf 2,000 miles!\n\nThat's easily factored in, though I see you are push the bounds of credulity at $50 per oil change.\n\n&gt;And there are many intangible benefits to driving an EV that make it really hard to find a \"comparable\" ICE car. I get to drive my Leaf solo in the carpool lane, which saves me about an hour a day in my commute, and I can park for free at LAX. And I can also charge for free at a multitude of public charging stations. Of course these are specific to my location\n\nExactly.  Not generally applicable, as with gas prices in your area.\n\n&gt;Doing the \"payback period\" calculation is rather disingenuous.\n\nWhy?  You may have reasons that another approach is better, but that doesn't mean a payback estimation is disingenuous.\n\n&gt;...without considering maintenance costs, rising gas prices, and intangibles.\n\nOr battery replacement at 8 years / 100k miles.  You'll note that you were selective in regard to your financing option.  Disingenuous?  Probably not, but one could certainly argue that you were.\n\n&gt;In summary, to immediately discount all the benefits of driving an EV just because you are an AGW skeptic and associate EVs with AGW alarmism is just moronic.\n\nI don't, and that's an unfair conclusion.  I look at every option before I buy a car.  I am hopeful that CNG vehicles will be price competitive by the time I need to buy another car.  I ran the numbers on EVs and they didn't work.",

They may not be called superchargers, and they may charge in 30 minutes - similar times to a Tesla supercharger - but that's because of relativity; the battery pack is less than half the size in most EVs, so even if charge times are similar to a Tesla, the actual rate of charge (in kilowatts) is much lower.",

My purchase criteria was very simple: Without making any allowances for the way it was powered, did I like it as a car? The answer was not only yes, but hell yes. I had tested a couple EVs before the days of lithium-ion batteries and had passed on them. The Think kinda-sorta blew me away relative to what I had feared it might be. It was a lot more fun to drive than I expected. And for the price, I'd have been a moron *not* to get one.\n\nI don't think I'd want to spend, say, 20 miles driving to and from work every day in it. But guess what? I'm retired, so I don't. For short trips -- five miles here, two miles there, 10 miles every now and then, and on rare occasions maybe 30 miles at a stretch -- it's great. It's definitely the best grocery-getter I've ever had, including all my gas cars. I'm constantly amazed at how much crap I can jam into it relative to how small it is. Much, much, much better than a Smart car in that regard.\n\nI might be wrong about availability of new Thinks, but I don't think I am. I believe they've given up the ghost, and that you cannot get a new Think anymore. If you're really interested, I'd try giving Hawthorne Auto a call. If anyone's going to know, they certainly will.",

Of course it can!\n\nCan a woodgas generator generate electricity efficiently enough to allow an EV motor to run with lower emissions than via solar, hydro, wind, or nuclear charging, or though generation through natural gas or even conventional auto gas? Based on the generators I've seen, the answer is probably no.\n\nWhile this could potentially be a niche product to wean us off of petroleum, many/most of us are interested in EVs because of the low emissions of charging electric vehicles via alternative power sources that avoid or lessen CO2 or NO2 emissions, such as solar, hydro, wind or even nuclear or CNG. Emissions are paramount. It's not a matter of proving you can generate enough power to charge an EV - there are loads of ways you can do that - it's a matter of proving you can charge an EV in a way that has less environmental impact than running a gas engine.",

        "comment": "A performance vehicle is a statement. A loud, visible statement that's been moulded by public perception, advertising and nearly a hundred years of power = combustion engine noise. There is an element of showing off, of making your stamp with a big, powerful engine. It's exactly the same reason some apes drag around branches and hammer on hollow logs - it's a display of power. Slamming through gears, tinkering late at night over your riced-up Honda Civic with an eye towards driving around and impressing your friends, watching cars drift around a track - it's about admiring and mastering that power.\n\nAn electric vehicle is also becoming its own statement. It says, I do not want all that. I want zero emissions, no pollution, no smell. I want effortless speed and acceleration. Loud cars are icky. I dislike driving and only want to get from A to B. I have never touched a wrench and I never want to.\n\nThe first group of people who see other people do that, well, they'd see just piping in artificial engine noise through a speaker as the final indignity. Oh, they'd change their tune as soon as they got behind the wheel of the new Roadster, but until then it's just a sense of vague unease that covers the unformed fear that all of that is ending.\n\nBut.\n\nIf it inherently made its own engine noise, if it was available to the hobbyist who wanted to cook something up in his garage, if it still reached down into the deep, primal part that was awed by power... well, then we've got something.\n\nAnd it is possible.

Musk saying considering is his way of shooting for the stars but just getting the moon. He has done it so many times but I can think of one where he was going to get rid of the 12v lead acid battery (I think that one was likely/sure) in the Y which didn't happen but the Plaid doesn't use lead acid but uses a 12v lithium (hopefully LFP) battery.",

A friend of mine was explicitly told as much by Volvo engineers when he picked up their Millionth Car at the factory..\n2. Emissions standards in the US are stupid.  Instead of &lt;Nastyness&gt; Per Unit Distance, they measure Concentration of &lt;Nastyness&gt; of tailpipe emissions.  This screws Diesel, because Diesel puts out more pollutants per unit volume (~1.3-1.4x the nastiness per gallon when compared to gas), it also drives somewhere around twice the distance per gallon (0.65-0.70x the nastiness per mile).  \nBut, because of how we measure it, it looks worse.  Kind of like how, *on paper*, Electric vehicles (and to a lesser extent, diesels) look less sporty, because they tend to have a lower HP rating...",

All of them as fast as all get out, and none of them anywhere near as fun to drive as my 2018 Nissan Leaf. I will never go back to a gasoline powered car again, and believe me no one is more surprised about this than me. I am a career mechanic and love cars, but driving an EV for me is more exhilarating than any gas car I’ve ever owned.  I guess if you’ve never driven one you won’t understand.",

        "comment": "Transcript of interview:\n\nInterview between Bianna Golodryga, Yahoo Finance anchor, and Mark Fields, CEO of Ford Motor Company\n\nGolodryga appears from anchor desk at Yahoo Finance, Fields is speaking in front of F-150 assembly line.\nYahoo Finance splash titles appear in square brackets.\n\n[Ford CEO:  We're making a Tesla for the masses]\n[Innovation in the Auto industry]\n\nBG:  Okay, let's then talk about innovation.  \nGoogle's driverless car madee a splash this year, but now it seems to be getting a lot of regulation roadblocks.\nMeanwhile in the UK, they're allowing them on the road in January.\nAre we behind the curve on driverless cars ?\n\n[Is US Behind on Driverless Technology? ]\n\nMF: Well, I think overall when you look at autonomous vehicles, in our case at Ford, you're gonna see driver \nassistive technologies migrate across our entire lineup over time.\n\nAnd I think when you look back and look worldwide, I think we're still at that stage where we're doing alot of research.\nA lot of sensor technology is getting better, the infrastructure is starting to build, \ndata availability is becoming more prevalent. \n\nSo I do think that as we go forward our approach at Ford is to look at this as an opportunity for us going forward, \nand that's exactly the way wer're going to look at it, both here and also in all the markets we do business.\n\nBG:  I want to turn to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla. You've said that Ford could also build a Tesla.   Are you working on this ?\nWhat exactly is youre relationship with Elon ?\n\n[Is Ford making its own Tesla ?]\n\nMF:  Overall what I mentioned was, the question was, do we have the capability, obviously, \nto produce electrified vehicles, and clearly we do, because he have a full lineup\nof electrified vehicles that have actually done well in the marketplace, relatively speaking,\nversus the rest of the industry.   We're Number 2 in the industry right now on electrified vehicles.\n\nBut we do have, we have tremendous capability in our organization and we're gonna stay focused on providing \nthat power of choice for consumers, Whether it's electrified vehicles, or gas-powered vehicles, or, or, or others, diesels, etcetera.\n\nAnd Elon, I don't know Elon well, but I think he's done, Tesla has done a very good job bringing electrified vehicles\ninto the consciousness of the American consumer.\n\nAnd clearly Teslas approach is to cater to a high end consumer, \nand our approach is to make sure it's attainable, electrified vehicles are attainable for the masses, and we're gonna continue along that path.\n\nBG: Any interest in buying Tesla ?\n\nMF: No, we're gonna stay focused on Ford.\n\n[Detroit Bankruptcy Hearing]\n\nBG:  Well Ford, obviously as we know is in Michigan, and US Bankruptcy Judge Stephen Rhodes recently ruled that Detroit could proceed forward with its bankruptcy filing.\nWhat does it mean for one of America's most iconic cities going forward ?\n\nMF:  Well, I think the emergency from bankruptcy is another very positive sign of the momentum that's gathering force here in the region\nand as a company we're going to continue to support that financially, philanthropically, and also through volunteerism.\n\nBG:  You and I share a common heritage, a Romanian heritage.   What would your grandparents think of that, of their grandchild now being head of one of the US's biggest companies ?\n\nMF:  Well, you know, I think they're very proud, but I couldn't be more proud to be here at Ford leading, because for me it's just a tremendous honor to lead this terrific team and this terrific company that has 111 years of history and heritage.\nand I just couldn't be more honored to lead the team going forward.\n\nI think, uh, that's terrific they have smiles on their faces, and that's great, and my approach is just to earn that every day.\n\nBG:  The Land of opportunity, for sure.  \n\nBG:  Finally, you have two sons.  What are their favorite cars, and be honest with us.\n\nMF:  [Laughs] Well, of course their favorite cars are Fords.   \nThey love, they love the Mustang as a matter of fact a few years ago when my son was learning to drive he said he wanted a Mustang\nand I said I'm not going to give a 16 year old kid a Mustang, and he looked me square in the eyes and said \"but Dad, I'll settle for the V-6\".\n\nBG:  Or you could get him a used one, too, right ?\nMF:  Exactly\n\nBG:  It's a big day for you, Mark, and we want to thank you for joining us.\nMF:  Thanks, Bianna \n\n[Ford Rolls out new F-150]",

They say something like 20 new models by 2023, and so far we've got the Hummer, a truck (possibly one and the same), and some sort of commercial van. \n\nI forget which trim Bolt I tried but the guys didn't seem too interested in bargaining and I overall liked the CPO Volt a lot better for a good $10-12k cheaper. The Bolt seats sucked and the trunk was tiny. \n\nI'm still waiting for like a Subaru Outback sized hatchback EV that fits 4 adults and still has a decent trunk. Maybe it's the Model Y, but that thing is so pricey. It's disheartening to read that GM plans to market most of their EVs under the Cadillac brand. Like honestly, I don't care about having 18\" rims and a glass roof and all that frivolous shit. Basically every EV right now is either a subcompact or a luxury toy.",

While an article from msnbc for example may be wrong in a lot of ways, I think it's helpful to be aware of what's being said about EVs in the mainstream.\n\nThis post is just about encouraging more people to dig through google and post what they like.  \n\nI'd like to check in here after I come home from work and find that all of the good articles have already been posted. ;)",

I had to dig 3 layers deeper to [this electrek article from 2016](https://electrek.co/2016/04/26/tesla-model-3-battery-pack-cost-kwh/) to get any number.\n\nStated is the following:\n&gt; Bereisa based his analysis on the base Model 3 being offered with a 60 kWh battery, like the Bolt, and on Tesla achieving a cost of ~$190/kWh. He estimates that Tesla’s current battery pack cost (cells, casing, cooling and entire pack) is at $260/kWh, while GM’s is at $215/kWh. GM’s cells and battery pack are manufactured by its partner LG Chem.\n\nAfter that a Tesla spokesperson corrected that:\n&gt; Evanson stated that Tesla’s battery pack cost is already below $190/kWh\n\nI don't know how you can make the assumption that tesla has cheaper batterys that on a number from 2016...  \nOn why other manufacturers don't reach 300 miles right now:  \nNoone uses 100kwh batteries right now, and european manufacturers have bigger buffers in the batteries. \nTesla seems to have slightly better motors/drivetrain optimisation, that play into it aswell.",

        "comment": "It's been discussed ad nauseam. They allocate during production a certain amount of CO2 emissions given a set amount of energy needed to produce the cars ignoring 1. It's still the fault of fossil fuels. 2. Energy production is not the same everywhere nor is it set to remain at current values anywhere nor is it the fault or responsibility of car makers to green it up, it's up to the companies providing said energy. It's basically blaming EVs for utility companies using coal and natural gas, or mining and shipping companies using oil based fuels. Can they be made without fossil fuels? Yes. Can they be made today in every country? No, there has to be a transition period.\n\nConsider the alternative, we don't make more EVs and batteries we just burn more fossil fuels. How exactly does that improve the situation? It doesn't, neither does blaming the clean sector for the shortcomings of the fossil fuel sector.\n\nIt's basically their twist on facts sounding a little something like this, imagine a caricature of a oil baron saying shit like \"Aha, in 2017 most of the energy used by humanity is from fossil fuels so when the clean tech engages in manufacturing, invariably most of the energy will be sourced from fossil fuels. In other words clean tech is a sham\". Undercut it's their fault we got here and they offer no solution besides more coal, more gas, more oil which is not a solution. If clean tech keeps growing it will eventually take over the energy sector and anything produced will rely on zero emission energy, it just doesn't happen over night, it will take decades, though some will get there before others.\n\nAs for the \"x ICE car is cleaner than y EV\", it's total BS given the smog that they produce in the cities where most people live will never be fixed without EVs and that's ignoring the GHG emissions affecting the climate.",

        "comment": "People give Nissan a hard time because their car can only do 70 miles, but what good is 250 miles if no one can actually afford it? \n------------------\nPeople buy Porsche Cayenne or Mercedes S series which are in the same category as Model X or Model S. Yes, Porsche and Mercedes are car brands, but that's the thing- people who buy Tesla wouldn't necessarily buy Porsche or Mercedes, I wouldn't buy them, because in my mind people who buy such cars are entitled jocks who care about 0 things in their lives except themselves (as proven by tons of pricks who drive these cars).\n\nAnd Tesla too reeks of ''status symbol'', even if these people who buy these cars hate the mentality and image ICE cars evoke, they still partially will buy them to show off. Tesla is easy on eyes and anyone near it, even if not knowing the brand, will immediately understand that it's an effing big electric car that only few can afford....\n\nPeople shouldn't compare Tesla's offerings with some kind of a budget sedan or SUV. That's not what Tesla sells. Tesla sells what Porsche or Mercedes sells and sells it at comparable price. And therefore in this segment they sell well. They chose the right way to attack the car market, as making a below $30 000 car with these specs in 2010 or even now would be a fucking impossible task... And not only because of batteries, but because of production lines, economies of scale etc. You can't ramp up production in 100s of thousands (sub $30 000 numbers, you have to sell in 100s of thousands, because profit margins are tiny) if you're a young company, even if you have the necessary cheap battery. The profit margins are really low, you have to ramp up not only the battery production (which at this scale does not exist) without ever proving any ability to make a car before you do so, but also buy and make stuff in bulk to drive down cost (economies of scale in action). Coda did many things wrong, and trying to compete with offerings like Nissan Leaf or in future Volkswagen E-Golf or BMW i3 is insane for a small, new car company....",

The state's largest wind farms kill, on average, more than 80 eagles per year. But the state is set to triple wind capacity in the coming years as it tries to become the first state in the nation to generate 33 percent of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2020.\"\n\n\"Case in point: In the Bay Area, when activists in the 1980s demanded a cleaner planet, the state responded with the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area. The state-approved wind farm, built with federal tax credits, kills 4,700 birds annually, including 1,300 raptors, among them 70 golden eagles, according to biological reports generated on behalf of the owners.\"\n\n\"Wind power in the U.S. generates 41,400 megawatts of electricity. California represents just a fraction of that total, suggesting the number of raptor kills is considerably higher nationwide. Yet according to records, USFWS has not prosecuted a single company for violating one of the many statutes protecting threatened and endangered birds.\"\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/08/16/energy-in-america-dead-birds-unintended-consequence-wind-power-development/\n\nhttp://www.abcbirds.org/abcprograms/policy/collisions/wind_policy.html\n\n&gt;cause bats to implode\n\n\"Dead bats are turning up beneath wind turbines all over the world. Bat fatalities have now been documented at nearly every wind facility in North America where adequate surveys for bats have been conducted, and several of these sites are estimated to cause the deaths of thousands of bats per year. This unanticipated and unprecedented problem for bats has moved to the forefront of conservation and management efforts directed toward this poorly understood group of mammals.\"\n\nhttp://www.mesc.usgs.gov/BatsWindmills/\n\n&gt;frighten horses\n\n\"Wendy Rousell, from the British Horse Society, said: \"The blades can cast a moving shadow that could spook horses.\"\n\n\"The British Horse Society said it is objecting to the plans because it claims the turbine would be too close to the bridleway network used by riders in the area.\"\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-18797049\n\n&gt;enrich rent-seeking toffs like David Cameron's father-in-law Sir Reginald Sheffield Bt\n\n\"his estate merely received a “modest income” from them, amounting to “less than one tenth of £3.5 million”. By my reckoning that is around £350,000 – modest to some more than others! Sir Reginald is, of course, perfectly within his rights to take this rent, but the turbines have incensed the community. He’s also planning a second development at nearby Flixborough Grange, again in the face of fierce local protests.\"\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/countryside/8716138/Why-Samantha-Camerons-dad-is-stirring-up-a-storm.html\n\n&gt;drive up electricity bills\n\n\"But a study of the Government’s own figures by the Renewable Energy Forum (REF), a specialist renewable energy consultancy, has accused DECC of deliberately misleading the public.\nREF claims its analysis of the Government’s own figures shows that two-thirds of households, about 17 million in all, will be worse off - even if energy efficiency targets are met in full.\"\n\n\"In a 54-page report published tomorrow [Monday], REF will conclude: “DECC has made unrealistic assumptions about the use of energy efficiency measures to offset the costs to households, but even on those optimistic assumptions 65 per cent of households will still be net losers.\"\n\n\"“In fact there is every reason to suppose that the efficiency measures will not live up to these expectations and that costs have been understated.”\n\"\n\n\"REF estimates that the UK’s climate change policies - which promote wind farms and other forms of renewable energy - will be responsible for 'major increases’ in the retail price of electricity and gas.\nIt estimates that electricity prices on domestic bills will rise by 27 per cent by 2020 and by 34 per cent on bills for medium-sized companies. Gas prices will rise by seven per cent and 11 per cent respectively.\"\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/renewableenergy/9276895/Electricity-bills-set-to-rise-to-pay-for-wind-farm-subsidies.html",

After my first experience with the Heybike Tyson (a purchase I made when I was starting out as an novice and admittedly naive e-bike rider) and after I did my research into e-bike laws (and subsequently found out the illegality of the Heybike Tyson, previously unknown to me), I made a promise to myself to be as careful as possible to when I went to purchase my next e-bike. And that was how I ended up getting the EBC Model J from my local bike shop, a purchase that I still do not regret, even despite my lengthy - and from time to time, hindered and frustrating - recovery from the stress-induced seizures I’ve experienced over the past six months or so. Sure, maybe me riding isn’t 100% the greatest idea, given the seizures. However, I know my body more than anyone, and I’m not stupid. If I feel exhausted or off on a certain day, I don’t ride. And sometimes, I’ll take up to a week off if need be. So, me still being in the recovery process of the previously mentioned seizures and therefore it being unadvisable to be riding my e-bike doesn’t necessarily equate to an inability to do so responsibly and safely. I always have Strava Beacon active when I ride, and I let my emergency contacts know my end destination and text them when I get there. Speaking of safety, you look awesome with that black on black. And you are definitely safe with that on. If my top speed is 28mph and wear a full face helmet, and I don’t deem that overkill, then you going over 40mph with that on is actually perfect. 👍",

It's used for a daily work commute of 16 miles round trip where the time back to 100% is usually 5-8 hours depending on the outside temperature.  \n\nDuring the weekends it's lots of hit and run trips for groceries, coffee, kids activities...  Level 1 is more then enough to get back to 100% in a reasonable amount of time.  Maybe once the ranges start going up Level 2 may become more useful.  \n\n**EDIT** Oh and just so you know EVs aren't that expensive.  I leased mine for $1600 down $133 a month.  I just tracked my gas this weekend via mint.com.  I'm on track to save almost $2000 in gas this year so it's pretty much as close to a free car as you can get.",

How I know about it, is having been reported in an interview with VW design team near the launch. Sadly don't remember any more. However journalist exactly asked about \"Well unlike some other cars, ID.3 doesn't have frunk. Why so? Technical limitations? Design choice? Surely it isn't accidental.\" Something like that.\n\nAnd then the good journalist let the design team member speak. He went on exactly how it went. For example, apparently *there was an VW internal design body mock up of ID.3. **with a frunk***. So not like they didn't know the idea existed. However the design concept with increased turning radius and maximized cabin volume (which of course then includes the cargo volume increase possibility on a collapsing rear seat car) won over in consideration.\n\nSimply ~we thought customers would appreciate the turning radius more and frunk doesn't even buy that much room compared to what putting it in would have eaten from the cabin space~.\n\nBut yeah, not as easy to make video. However I think someone did one. Demonstrating turning circles of various EVs on parking lot. As I remember main focus was the ID.3 and another EV with good turning radius, the Honda E. Then compared bigger EVs with worse turning radius.\n\nBut yeah. Not as simple as noting in 5 minute design walk around \"the dumbos didn't even manage to put frunk in\".",

I've never had a taxi that stopped to refuel with petrol so the idea that an EV would do the same is idiotic.\n\nThere's just no good reason not to make this full EV given there is a good (enough) infrastructure today, that will only continue to grow. Don't make it a full EV with 70miles of range obviously, but 150-200 is plenty, especially as drivers will stop for lunch at some point (or whatever legal requirement there is to not drive for more than X hrs without breaks) and so charge.\n\nPeople don't need to be eased into anything. If these were Tesla Model Xs they would be used in a very similar way to ICE people carriers and noone would bat an eye.",

In the case of electric cars, much more material is required, and much of it is very expensive and will not get cheaper because it is subject to the same laws of depletion as petroleum.  \n\nI do expect prices to eventually come down for electric cars, but not soon, and I only expect them to be economically viable when gasoline becomes very expensive.",

        "comment": "Yeah, that's just way too high a rate for a lease.  Tier 1 in SDG&amp;E, their lowest rate, is 17c/kWh.  So you are actually paying MORE for your first 300 or so kWh's per month.  Your average rate with a $126 bill in SDG&amp;E is around 22c.  So while they are saving you some money, you need to be coming in considerably lower for it to really make sense.\n\nHere's what your lease is costing you: $38,215.37 over 25 years.\n(Math: $126 payment - (450 annual savings/12)= monthly $88.5 lease payment, or $1062/year.  Calculated out for 25 years with 2.9% escalator and added together.  Want to hear the part that's gonna make you really, REALLY mad?  Guess what that price is when you divide out your total payments?  $127 a month.  The exact same amount you are paying right now.\n\nIf we assume your average cost for electricity is 22.5c/kW, you are likely averaging somewhere around 560kWh per month, or 6720kWh annually.  A 4kW system should take care of that for around $15k - approximately 10 year payback, and the 30% tax credit (assuming you have tax liability to take advantage of it), makes that system about $10,500 - a 7 year payback.\n\nLeases sound seductive because they focus on c/kW, and monthly savings.  But that lease will cost you about $28,000 MORE in the next 25 years over just buying a system.  For some people they are a fantastic option, and I carry a lease product and recommend it when the numbers line up.  For you, I would not recommend the lease option.\n\nDo please note, however, that my prices are based on you paying cash for your system.  Retail loans (HERO, other PACE type programs, or bank loans) are typically very expensive and don't save you much over a lease - maybe 15% less over a 20 or 25 year term.  I am also assuming no added costs based on electrical panel, roof type, or roof azimuth.\n\nIf interested in a quote and you aren't in LADWP, or want numbers based on your actual usage rather than my guesses, feel free to PM me.  =)",

        "comment": "1) Yes, climate change is the most significant challenge humanity, as a race, has ever faced.\n2)The main causes of climate change are over-consumption as well as our love for fossil fuels. By running millions of vehicles and power-plants, this releases an extremely large amount of CO2 into the atmosphere, which is a green house gas. (Double Check) I believe we burn over 20 million barrels of oil a day in the United States alone! To reduce this the best option is to move to electric vehicles as well as better alternatives to energy, wind, solar, nuclear. Some personal action that can be taken is reducing meat consumption, specifically red-meat (beef) as well as reducing shower time. limiting daily showers to 5 minutes can reduce 100s of pounds of carbon emissions per person! \n3) I try to remain hopeful for the future, but on the same token, I am very concerned. The affects of climate change are already being felt, according to the Pentagon, and this issues will only continue to worsen. Millions, possibly billions will be displaced as well as food shortage, water shortage and ever rising temperatures/climate shifts. \n4) The best way to help combat this, besides what I stated above is to talk about it. Talk Talk Talk. The more people become aware, the more they are willing to seek action or force policy makers to take action. Provide them with hard science, and if they disregard institutions like NASA and their verdict, well, this is why I am cynical.\n5) People should most certainly be aware, humanity and our pale blue dot are in a balance, where we need the dot far more than it needs us. \nBest of luck on your project!",

Also pay attention to any billing / network fees like ChargePoint and Blink have.  As an FYI, the ChargePoint and Blink fees, even if you zero out the portion you're allowed to, make using their stations cost over twice as much as the power cost (at least in my area) in addition to high fees for initial install.",

My Tesla rate was going up the last few periods while my other car went down. At the end, I happen to be in an accident and the reason I did not get another Tesla after first one was totaled (with an oddly low damage value) was the inability to find certified body shop to do estimate quickly - needed to have towed out of metro area as all local ones were too swamped. If it would have been repairable it would have been months in limbo.",

They took it to the dealer who said the AC wasn't properly draining the water from the condenser, and that they'd order the necessary parts to fix it, but they'd take a couple weeks to come in.  They said my friends could keep driving the car in the meantime they just won't have any AC.\n\nAbout a week later the car is dead as a brick.  They have it towed to the dealer.  The dealer says their HV battery has been submerged in water and they need a new one.  They say my friend's must have driven it through a flood and they won't be covering it under warranty, despite the fact that a week before they were there because they heard water sloshing under the car and were told it was fine.\n\nThis was a few months ago and it still isn't resolved.  I believe the car is still at the dealer.  They have an attorney but it doesn't look like anything will happen.  I believe they're trying to get their own insurance to just total the car now.",

        "comment": "Holy 😅 I live in Norway. The legal limit is 20km/h, some buy bikes that go faster, but they are technically illegal to drive. You also have to buy insurance, which you can only get on the legal bikes. I usually don't have a helmet, but drive pretty safely. People on regular bikes zoom past me. I also see people on escooters drive pretty recklessly, so I just hope they don't ruin it for everyone else  but I would be one of those who argue how people on bikes are way more reckless they should have stricter laws and police who actually did their job in this regard.\n\nA person on an escooter/ebike are classified as a motorized vehicle and have laws to abide. Police probably won't really do anything about it though. I used to live in oslo and the bikers there usually never really cared about traffic laws and got angry at me who actually did. They would clear a cross where I was waiting for green and they would just zoom into traffic. I am surprised there aren't more accidents than there are",

You must have really hated this Fox News article:\n\n\"California supports roughly 2,500 golden eagles. The state's largest wind farms kill, on average, more than 80 eagles per year. But the state is set to triple wind capacity in the coming years as it tries to become the first state in the nation to generate 33 percent of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2020.\"\n\n\"Case in point: In the Bay Area, when activists in the 1980s demanded a cleaner planet, the state responded with the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area. The state-approved wind farm, built with federal tax credits, kills 4,700 birds annually, including 1,300 raptors, among them 70 golden eagles, according to biological reports generated on behalf of the owners.\"\n\n\"Wind power in the U.S. generates 41,400 megawatts of electricity. California represents just a fraction of that total, suggesting the number of raptor kills is considerably higher nationwide. Yet according to records, USFWS has not prosecuted a single company for violating one of the many statutes protecting threatened and endangered birds.\"\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/08/16/energy-in-america-dead-birds-unintended-consequence-wind-power-development/\n\nhttp://www.abcbirds.org/abcprograms/policy/collisions/wind_policy.html",

        "comment": "Goes back to Henry Ford. He established the franchised dealership model as a way for Ford to avoid the cost overhead of carrying excess inventory and of owning/maintaining a bunch of real estate by having franchised dealers (independent businesses) carry the costs instead. He also brought auto financing into the picture so that people could afford the cars and dealers would have another avenue to profit. Other manufacturers followed suit.\n\nProtectionist laws were passed in different states so that the manufacturers couldn’t sell cars directly and undercut their own franchised dealerships (which are independently owned and operated). There was usually never an intent that automakers who had never even had dealers to protect would be covered by these laws, but states like Michigan changed laws like these recently (after strong lobbying from the dealer lobby) to include even this category of automakers, thus disallowing Tesla from selling direct to the consumer. Massachusetts, however, went the opposite direction and said their protectionist law applies only to automakers who already have a dealer network. \n\nA big part of the problem is that the laws differ from state to state and so anyone fighting the status quo has to go state by state. Auto dealerships are something like a trillion dollar a year industry, so there’s a lot of money at stake for them in this fight. It’s no surprise that they’re fighting it with everything they’ve got. Changes to the protectionist laws are an existential threat for them.\n\nOh, and many banks also have a vested interest in the dealership business model by providing short term loans (known as “floor plan financing”) to dealers so that dealers can have a bunch of inventory on the lot without actually putting out the cash to buy the vehicles outright.",

Source: https://www.teslamotors.com/sites/default/files/blog_attachments/gigafactory.pdf  \n  \nFurthermore, look at what they actually made so far: https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/136669/tesla-potential-annual-sales_large.png  \n  \nThey have only made around 100k so far. This is with thousands of Model X orders waiting, with Elon on the recent conference call trying to transfer demand away from X to the S due to extremely limited X production.  \n  \n500k per year is at least 4 years out, according to Tesla's own estimates, which have been proven far too ambitious throughout their history.   \n  \nEdit: one final point. This isn't just my musing, Elon Musk himself said that they won't be demand constrained on the conference call last month. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJkYSWZ3d1Y",

        "comment": "I’m really glad it fits what you need.  I just don’t believe the price point you’re going for represents the average buyer in the market and even if it’s close, people don’t typically like bare bone packages.  \n\nOn the ID site right now, the base price is $40k.  Which after taxes and tags is a little below $43.  Add in destination and you’re looking at 44 easy.  \n\nNow add in a bottom tier extra, in this case the “Statement” package.  That’s $4500... 4500!!!!\n\nYou’re now sitting at 48,500.  Now do you want AWD?  That’ll be an additional $3680.  You’re now north of $52k for a car aimed at RAV4 shoppers.\n\nOr you take it bare bones, at 44 (after taxes, tags, and docs).\n\nI’m still arguing that is not the price range of the average CUV shopper and if that is a price range that they’re almost comfortable with, they probably really want some extras at that point.\n\nNow take a used 2019 Honda CRV touring, I’m seeing prices between 27 and 32 with low mileage.  Whew, I’d be hard pressed to think a $40k FWD suv with half the cargo space is going to work for a family with two kids that has zero extras.\n\nI’d reiterate, if it works for you, that’s great, but on the electric vehicle subreddit, I think it’s a vacuum.  A majority of CUV shoppers are looking for cheaper, more luxuriously equipped, AWD, easy to buy and very available vehicles.  \n\nThese articles bother me because i think it encourages auto makers this they’re doing a great job with providing options that comparable to ice cars, and the truth is, they really really aren’t.  And certainly not a comparable price point, even with the gas savings.",

Your whole point number 1. incorrectly reverses the burden of proof.  The burden of proof is on AGW because you must prove that the recent history diverges from the more distant past.  In addition, I think you've made some assertions about the application of current technology to reducing CO2 emissions that I may not agree with.  If you mean nuclear power plants, then I agree.  If you mean solar and wind, then I do not agree.  If you mean we should be turning thorium plans into working prototypes, then I agree.  If you mean we should mandate electric cars, then I do not.\n\nI agree it is highly urgent to reform energy policy, but I would concentrate on replacing oil and then coal with natural gas and then nuclear to improve the strength of our foreign policy, provide domestic jobs, and reduce CO2 emission as a bonus - just in case.\n\nChina, India, Russia, and most of the rest of the world will do whatever they damn well please.  So AGW solutions must either support themselves in the marketplace or improve the adopters life (better to do both) or they will fail.  The only way that this will change is if the evidence for AGW becomes dramatically stronger than it is today.",

The only one I can think of is the KIA Soul.  And aren't all the other current and planned KIA/Hyundai EVs using CCS?\n\nHow long has 100kw chademo been available? It's been a while right? Can the '18 LEAF take 100kw chademo? Nope!  Can the Soul? It sounds like it.  But has anybody ever encountered a 100kw chademo?  Is Electrify America going to start installing faster chademo along side their fast CCS chargers?\n\nI wish we could all just use a small elegant port like Tesla, but have it universal across all brands.  I'm allowed to dream right?",

The Tesla has a frunk because many systems are integrated with one another. The VW doesn't because they don't integrate. It shows - painfully so - in the low efficiency of the VW cars.",

        "comment": "I haven't tried any supercars but I've driven one of the mid trim level Taycans, the Audi e-tron, Polestar 2, Model 3 Performance and LR, Model S (non plaid). The Taycan and e-tron are excellent and fun, but quite honestly are obscenely expensive and at that price point I can easily think of at least 5 ICE cars that are more fun to drive. Within any somewhat reasonable price range there is simply no comparability as far as performance cars are concerned for a few reasons.\n\n1. Weight. Weight does not absolutely mean it is a bad car but under 90k there simply are not any EV's that are made with performance in mind so the weight is more devastating than it is in vehicles that are engineered to account for it more. EV's focus only on straight line speed.\n2. Price to performance, EV's are extremely overpriced compared to equivalent cars. A model 3 performance is almost the same price as a Toyota Supra. Looking at the Taycan, that car is over 100k, at that price point there are so many options that I can't even list them all.\n3. Track and backroad use is extremely limited for most EV's. A model 3 performance simply cannot keep up with even a GR86 on Autocross or tracks despite being way more powerful because the dynamics are not set up for that. That doesn't mean the Model 3 is a bad car, but it simply isn't made with driving dynamics in mind. This is not even getting into power throttling and charging/range issues.\n4. Feeling, I am not joking when I say that I drove a Tesla extensively for months and took it on backroads and track trying to push it, I can confidently say that a 30k WRX or GTI are 100% more fun and engaging and even perform better in every way except for straight-line.",

Electricians, plumbers, roofers, ac companies have added solar to their portfolio and competition is high, driving prices down and profits with it.\n\nYou will need to differentiate your company and find ways to reach your potential customers while competing with bigger budgets and name recognition. You will also deal with economies of scale in materials pricing, and you ahve to maintain a professional image while keeping overhead low.\n\nThe Treasury 1603 grants have expired (as of Sep 30) and tax credits may be removed depending on who gets into office. Rebates have been around for a while, so their levels have dropped or been eliminated. \n\nThe kWh cost and weather will define payback for the customer, and attractiveness of your product will depend on this. You will need a leasing partner, since the majority of solar being installed now is on lease form.\n\nIf you can keep overhead low, do most of the work yourself (plans, install, sell) and deal with strong competition go for it. It is a great industry to work in and you get to meet and help a lot of people. Solar is easy to work with and is easy to break in the industry. Costs have dropped so the cost to enter the market have dropped. Make the right connections beginning and you will be fine.\n\nBest of luck,",

PHEVs are growing faster than BEVs are, but BEVs are still growing at a pretty rapid clip while conventional ICE vehicles are seeing total sales and market share drop pretty rapidly. I wouldn't be surprised if even plug-less conventional hybrids aren't doing too well at this point. There's a very good chance that plug-ins make up a majority of the Chinese new vehicle market in at least one of the remaining quarters this year and a non-zero chance that plug-ins make up a majority of the Chinese new vehicle market for the year overall.\n\nFor BYD, some of it probably depends on when they update their platforms for when BEVs grow faster versus PHEVs or vice versa.",

But it's barely better. You're just saving yourself money at that point.\n\n\n\nIt's simply a random thing anti EV people clap back with, to give anti EV talking points. Kind of like how some say EVs are bad because greater tire wear which is more micro plastics, but don't actually get to the heart that all vehicles are trending too big and getting heavier.\n\n\nI mean sure tradeoffs, they're right, but the tradeoffs aren't even close.\n\n\nSo... The real people who are holding out are those who:\n\n\n(1) Care about depreciation. EVs are like cell phones and are rapidly improving and old tech becomes disposable quickly. Next jump in North America is conversion to NACS which will make CCS vehicles depreciate more. People care about having a car long term that they won't lose their ass on if they need to sell it when life changes.\n\n\n(2) Concerned about infrastructure. This concern is two fold. Either (a) you live in an apartment and don't have access to L2 overnight charging and/or (b) the DCFC stations aren't as plentiful or as convenient as gas stations for time and location wise. \n\n\n(3) Long Range EVs still charge slowly compared to gasoline. Us enthusiasts make excuses but the reality is people want to wait 10 minutes tops. People value convince highly. It's important to note this battery tech fest will be hit within the next 5 years, guaranteed. The only limit will be charger rollout -- infrastructure limitations.\n\n\nNote: They're already at 11 mins 48 seconds.\n\n\n(4) Batteries are expensive, thus like for like EV models tend to be roughly 10k more than comparative gasoline vehicles.",

        "comment": "Since the scale makes it hard to see the values for metals other than copper, these figures may be more useful (from p.228 on). It looks like a **12-week power storage capacity** would be required to buffer intermittent power supply from wind and solar (fig. 34).\n\n* For 48-hour storage capability, we'd need 3x the amount of Copper, 3x the amount of Nickel, 93x the amount of Lithium, 12x the amount of Cobalt, 34x the amount of Graphite, and 36x the amount of Vanadium as was mined/produced from 1990-2023.\n* For 28-day storage capability, we'd need 12x the amount of Copper, 21x the amount of Nickel, 1,100x the amount of Lithium, 107x the amount of Cobalt, 351x the amount of Graphite, and 453x the amount of Vanadium as was mined/produced from 1990-2023.\n\nAnother useful metric is the years required to produce a given metal at 2019 rates of production for a full renewable transition (EV's, batteries, wind turbines, solar panels and new power; 28-day buffer):\n\n* Copper: 255 Years\n* Nickel: 533 Years\n* Lithium: 13,397 Years\n* Cobalt: 2,325 Years\n* Graphite: 4,204 Years\n* Vanadium: 9,629 Years\n\nProduction aside, we don't even have enough mineral reserves + resources to create a 28-day buffer (p.240) for a single generation of renewables (and remember that a 12-week buffer was recommended).\n\nWe obviously can't keep burning fossil fuels forever either, so my big takeaway from this study (and others like it) is that **we simply can't expect to sustain our high-energy, high-consumption lifestyles through the end of this century.** Degrowth (i.e. a reduction in per-capita consumption, and likely a corresponding decline in birth rates) seems like the only viable path forward, although our world leaders don't seem willing to touch that idea with a 10-foot pole.",

        "comment": "&gt;Go back to Volta and plot the curve.\n\nThe thing about exponential curves is that each years' progress **must** exceed the previous years', and by more then the previous years' exceeded the year before that.  If the curve was once well-fit by an exponential curve, it is no longer.  It's probably best modelled by a logistic curve.\n\n&gt;Coming very soon, some are organic, membrainless.\n\nI have watched dozens if not hundreds of promising technologies that were supposed to arrive Real Soon Now™ that never did.   Why is this one different?\n\n&gt;Donald Sadoway's high temperature batteries are also a proven new technology ready to be developed for grid storage.\n\nIIRC, his approach requires antimony, and more of it than exists to be useful.\n\n&gt;Storage capacity is following the law of accelerated returns.\n\nFirst, there's no such law.  It's a phrase Kurzweil coined that to discuss how strong AI will cause innovation to increase superlinearly.  The problem is that it doesn't match observation.  \n\nSecond, storage isn't following any superlinear curve at all.  Saying it's progress is even linear would be generous.  Storage tech has advanced at a glacial pace compared to most other areas.\n\n&gt;When one technology taps out, a new one carries on the accelerated return, just as lithium took off after lead aced reached limits.\n\nExcept lead-acid is *still* the de facto standard for commercial battery storage, despite what one guy built in his garage.\n\n&gt;It's like the Wright Brothers just made the first flight...\n\nYou keep arguing that batteries are a new technology.  They predate the Wright Brothers' airplane.  There were electric cars contemporary with Henry Ford.  Not only that, there are indeed physical limits to battery storage.  Look at it this way.  The most energy dense chemical we regularly deal with is diesel fuel.  That's about the upper limit for chemical storage, but the difference is that the oxygen it is combined with is drawn from the air.  Batteries have all chemical components contained within, so the best energy density we can get will be about half that of diesel.  The critical area will be cost, though, not density, when we talk about static storage.\n\n&gt;Power companies are already in full panic mode...\n\nFunny, I deal with two different utility power companies and one small-scale power company on a regular basis.  What you speak of isn't even on their radar.\n\n&gt;There are many days when even northern latitude Germany makes 70%+ of it's energy from free renewable sources...\n\nYeah, and they have to pay other countries to take it because they can't store it.  How is it a viable business model to have to pay others to take your product?\n\n&gt;Government is in panic mode over losing gas taxes to electric vehicles.\n\nOf the 16 million vehicles sold each month in the U.S., how many are EVs?  6,000?  Even if it were 16,000, you are talking one out of every thousand cars sold.  I think the gas tax revenue is sound for a while yet.",

So fwiw to them they were paid in full.\n\nI am also not sure how a contract change could affect my loan. It was submitted by Sunrun for me so even $1000 off could change my payments. Granted, the loan is for like 20 years at 1.5% interest so would be minimal.. idk though. Further argument I guess is that I’ve been paying interest through my loan on their screw up?",

Now the retail price is for anyone that is handy enough to buy it themselves to install.  It’s a kit.  Everything you need to DIY.  Switch is built in so no need for a permit if you are installing it and don’t need to pull the meter. I’ve seen a lot of installs from tiny homes, retrofits to existing solar, and commercial applications where the unit was installed without the hassle of dealing with a third party to get it installed.  CNET rated the EP900 as the best overall home battery just edging out the PW3.",

It switches on in a matter of milliseconds so that any running appliances receive smooth power, don't get damaged, and no brownouts are experienced.\n\nGood example is a hospital.  Can't have brownouts or damaged appliances in hospitals, so a traditional setup would have a UPS kick on immediately when power goes down and allow a diesel generator to ramp up.\n\nBecause of its intended purpose a UPS is designed to discharge a large amount of power over a short time period.\n\nThe PowerWall is mean to be more of a deep cycle battery.  Compared to a UPS storing the same amount of energy, it would discharge less power over a more extended time period.\n\nWith the advancements in battery and power electronic technology, the PowerWall could essentially switch on just as quickly as a UPS.\n\nFor your purposes it seems easier and cheaper to just add more SLA cells.",

        "comment": "&gt;Which is exactly what US and UK have done so far - they have (successfully) exported CO2 and SO2 pollution to the 3rd world :(\n\nWhich is exactly what many of us said would be the problem with Carbon Dioxide Taxes.  As long as an industry has a place that they can shift production to make something cheaper, they will.  It doesn't really matter if the increased cost comes higher labor costs, higher materials costs or higher taxation - the bottom line is cost of production.\n\nMaking manufacturing more expensive here through carbon taxation won't keep industries from producing goods, it will just force them to shift production away from the developed world, where other environmental controls are stronger.\n\nThis is why I've always argued against a carbon tax; it's not globally applied. One may have as well declared the goal of the carbon tax was to force manufacturing to move to China or India, rather than to reduce carbon emissions worldwide, since that was the obvious result.\n\n&gt;The most obvious problem is that once you factor in all the costs burning fuel to release 10 billion tonnes of CO2 and then ‘sequester’ 1 billion is far more expensive and far, far riskier than to just burn for 9 billion tonnes in the first place\n\nHere, I oddly agree with you.  Sequester is a poor solution, as there are other costs associated with coal and oil that simply using sequester does not address.  Black carbon (soot), fly ash, and other remains from the burning of coal and oil will still pollute the air and water of our world.  Unfortunately, when we start talking about costs, it's still *cheaper* to simply ignore that pollution than to address it. \n\nWe will eventually have to figure out how to move beyond fossil fuels.  It's not \"if\" but \"when.\"  That's a technological answer that won't be solved by taxing carbon or trading shares in carbon emissions.  This world has a LOT of energy coming to it by solar radiation.  We've simply got to figure out better ways of harnessing that energy.  Solar panels that convert 15% of the energy into electricity are not good enough.  Wind turbines are good, but the wind doesn't blow consistently enough to use without a better method of storing the peak energy production to use when the energy draw is at peak.\n\nWhat we really, really need is a better energy storage medium.  After all, that's all coal and oil really are; energy storage.  If we could figure out a cheap way to convert existing atmospheric carbon dioxide back into natural gas, for example, or even into a higher energy liquid fuel like biodiesel, we could have a sustainable, recyclable energy production system that would not pull any more carbon out of the ground.\n\nWhen, not if, the inevitable change from holocene to glaciation period comes, we may reconsider how much atmospheric CO2 we want, if we ever get to a reliable answer on how CO2 affects the climate.  The interglacial period has lasted now for around 12,000 years, which is pretty close to the average total length of an interglacial.  The change to glaciation may not be here for 500 years, but when it does come, we  humans will want to know how to reduce the effects of the change, to maintain as close to optimal conditions as we can manage.\n\nAt that point, we may start calling for some engineered global warming.  That will be an interesting time.  Too bad I'll miss it.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; Several recent reports have shown that the cost of solar is often comparable or nearly comparable to the average price of power on the utility grid, a threshold known as grid parity.\n\n&gt; Solar prices will continue to fall; a study by Oxford University researchers, published last month in Research Policy, found that annual price declines of 10 percent will continue well into the next decade, enabling solar to supply 20 percent of global energy needs by 2027.\n\n&gt; Falling costs and wider availability of solar systems coupled with energy storage will enable solar households to store energy for later use, making rooftop solar more economical on its own-regardless of whether it ever reaches true grid parity.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/45ye9a/suddenly_the_solar_boom_is_starting_to_look_like/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.6, ~36605 tl;drs so far.\") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PMs and comment replies are read by the bot admin, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **solar**^#1 **grid**^#2 **power**^#3 **energy**^#4 **parity**^#5",

Installed by Solar City (now Tesla Solar), and a big fuss and legal stuff.  Tesla Solar blamed poor connectors (Amphenol?).  Perhaps no longer a concern since most panels now use a common connector (MC4) and most are now wired more in series for higher string voltage (\\~350 VDC) at less current (\\~12 A).\n\nSolar carports are great since they serve double duty to shade cars.  In inland California and AZ/NV, people search for any shade in Summer.  Car interiors and paint don't last long in the evil sun.  First time in the Central Valley, driving near Porterville one Summer day, I noticed many parked cars with the hoods open.  I thought strange so many would break-down, then I figured out it was a local custom to pop the hood in Summer to help cool off the engine.  Will be funny if owners continue that with a battery-car, popping open the frunk.",

Do you see the GNR technologies coming on line to mitigate that kind of a catastrophe?**\n\n&gt;RK: Absolutely. Those projections are based on linear thinking, as if nothing‘s going to happen over the next 50 or 100 years. It‘s ridiculous. For example, we‘re applying nanotechnology to solar panels. The cost per watt of solar energy is coming down dramatically. As a result, the amount of solar energy is growing exponentially. It‘s doubling every two years, reliably, for the last 20 years. People ask, “Is there really enough solar energy to meet all of our energy needs?” It‘s actually 10,000 times more than we need. And yes you lose some with cloud cover and so forth, but we only have to capture one part in 10,000. If you put efficient solar collection panels on a small percentage of the deserts in the world, you would meet 100% of our energy needs. And there‘s also the same kind of progress being made on energy storage to deal with the intermittency of solar. There are only eight doublings to go before solar meets100% of our energy needs. We‘re awash in sunlight and these new technologies will enable us to capture that in a clean and renewable fashion. And then, geothermal — you have the potential for incredible amounts of energy.\n\n&gt;Global warming — regardless of what you think of the models and whether or not it‘s been human-caused —it‘s only been one degree Fahrenheit in the last 100 years. There just isn‘t a dramatic global warming so far. I think there are lots of reasons we want to move away from fossil fuels, but I would not put greenhouse gasses at the top of the list.\n\n&gt;These new energy technologies are decentralized. They‘re relatively safe. Solar energy, unlike say nuclear power plants and other centralized facilities, are safe from disaster and sabotage and are non-polluting. So I believe that‘s the future of energy, and of resource utilization in general.",

        "comment": "&gt; I have seen very few commercial panels pass the 23% efficiency mark\n\nI think you are looking at the CELL level efficiency not the PV module level.   There are cells above 23% but not PV modules.  The efficiency is just the ratio of power produce to area and PV modules include non-production space like the border and some space between the cells.   \nSunpower has some of the most efficient PV modules just under 23%: https://us.sunpower.com/sites/default/files/media-library/data-sheets/ds-x21-series-335-345-residential-solar-panels.pdf \n\n&gt;  it seems to me that solar could become a much more viable option if we had an efficiency boost of 20-40% in PV panels.\n\npossibly but as stated the efficiency is just the ratio of area to power generated.  Since most homes have plenty of space to generate the power to offset their usage, what is more important is the cost per watt.   Getting the cost down to generate the same power is not the same as efficiency.   The cost per watt has been dropping year over year for some time now.",

Everything works fine as long as clouds don't interfere, but for how long does the stored energy allow operation, or in other words for how many cloudy days can this particular type of solar power produce power before running out of stored energy? If the answer is anywhere close to 0, then this type of solar power is unfortunately just as incapable of baseload electricity production as other forms of solar power.",

        "comment": "My $50/mwh price is based on the online tool PVWatts, which takes into account local weather conditions (including lack of productivity at night) in determining its annual energy output. I used a conservative average of production across the US. 24/7/365 production does not enter into the calculation, nor do the costs of other production facilities. The only utility costs I've included in my calculation are installation of transformers to connect the arrays to existing utility lines. \n\nTo expand on your comments without hitting every detail, solar is less than .1% of our nation's power. If it jumps up to 10% of our daylight production, I easily forsee the energy storage market gaining significant investment. In other words, nighttime production would follow industry growth. However, we already have a surplus of energy at night, and so I imagine a transition to 100% solar, even if it were the cheapest form of energy, would take a significant amount of time due to existing infrastructure. \n\nSimilarly, we would already be doing solar if we lacked our existing infrastructure, and so in that sense, the electric grid already \"subsidizes\" traditional forms of energy that can't be sited at the point of use.\n\nFurthermore, I don't put much stock in \"utility scale\" solar. The economies of scale advantages begin to decline once that shipping container is full, and unlike traditional power plants, an entire solar power plant can be contained within a shipping container. Likewise, roof-mounted solar is retail based using otherwise useless rooftop. There's a slew of cost reasons (earth work, property tax, etc) that say commercial rooftops are the best market for solar. This was actually the case before the stimulus. Post-stimulus, the utility sector is the largest. There is more value in distributed solar - for instance, the loss of production when a cloud passes over the array drops out, as the net production of the distributed power sites wash out the loss of the individual site. This intermittancy is why we need peak natural gas with wind and utility-scale solar, but it is not needed with distributed solar. \n\nOn a different note, solar right now does not get the same financing terms as traditional power plants. If we had the ability to get 30 year low interest bond financing, we wouldn't need the significant upfront subsidies.\n\nAs to your theoretical example, the solution lies in how dense that city is. For instance, the Northeast coast cannot build new transmission lines to meet the density-driven demand, simply because there is no more empty space to eminent domain the power lines. So you can either brute force it at a higher cost by accepting significant line loss, or you can generate locally on a rooftop. The price of electricity drops significantly as you move into less dense areas. Wilmington Delware pays 100% more than Fairfax, Virgnia. Solar on the northeast coast would continue to gain market share even if all renewable subsidies were eliminated tomorrow. \n\nFurthermore, if your theoretical city existed where there is no electric grid, you would likely be powered off diesel (Africa, Island Countries) at which point solar is a no-brainer. Diesel generators cost around $500/mwh. Building the tranmission lines would be expensive.... the USA built much of its transmission lines with tax money via a rural energy expansion program in the 1930's. That expenditure allowed traditional power plants to become much more cost effective, but Africa lacks the tax revenue of the USA to accomplish such a feat. Furthermore, it might leapfrog technologies (think cell phones) and avoid building the lines all together. So if you start with a blank slate, solar is probably a good route to go. You might do some wind to reduce night time storage requirements.\n\nSo the worst place for solar would be a relatively spare area with an existing power grid infrastructure. But the answer to your question would still depend on lifecycle analysis. If you don't value the cost of storing nuclear waste, it's probably the best way to go. If you don't value the cost of carbon emissions or environmental destruction, coal could be good. As an engineer, I look at carbon emissions as I would any byproduct - its waste. What is the cost to capture that waste, given that other technologies are emissions free at the point of generation? There are plenty of uses for that carbon, but as its cheaper to dump it into the atmosphere, there's no incentive for carbon capture. Likewise, its cheaper for me to throw my trash into the woods, but I put it in a trash can because I can get fined for littering. By avoiding the fine, we can take all our trash and put it in one place, minimizing its damage. So I think it makes sense to put some sort of carbon taxation into your LCOE model. Most presentations I've seen state that the cost of doing 60% carbon capture would increase electricity prices by 2-3 cents per kwh. Solar does 100% carbon capture, but maybe the value of carbon capture is not 1 for 1. \n\nBut maybe it needs to be 1 for 1? We can debate climate change until New York City sinks into the Atlantic Ocean. All I know is that the traditional guys would have to increase their costs by 20% or so to capture 40% less than what my technology does. So I think the ITC is a fair exchange for a lack of carbon tax policy. I also think we'd still have an industry without the ITC or a carbon tax.\n\nLastly, there are some utility advantages to solar. Namely, transformers experienced reduced load at the hottest times of the day. This means lower grid operation costs. Furthermore, when solar is producing peak demand, some company somewhere is being dinged its peak demand charge for the month. By definition, that rate is above the average price of electricity. So even if a net-metering forces the utility to buy the solar electricity at its retail energy rate, the utility still profits off the transaction by selling that peak energy at above retail rate, plus operation savings.\n\nThe main problem with the industry is that utilities don't yet understand how they can profit with solar. As subsidies are replaced with retail-price power purchase agreements, models emerge where the utility, array owner, project financier, and non-participant all profit. We are currently in this transition period, which makes the industry quite exciting.",

Depending on your water source, you may find that a capillary action [sand culture ](http://www.hydroponics.com.au/issue-02-sand-culture/) works better for water delivery.  Another option is [a wick system](http://www.homehydrosystems.com/hydroponic-systems/wick-system_systems.html)\n\n2. If you are pumping water to an elevated cistern you can do all your pumping when the sun is strong, or when the batteries are fully charged and greatly extend your battery life.  This is particularly good if your plants all have similar water requirements.\n\n4. Another option that is frequently missed is **lowering the hight of your crop** by using a an underground greengouse or [walipini](http://www.treehugger.com/green-architecture/build-underground-greenhouse-garden-year-round.html#14408725501511)\n\nIf any of these methods lower your power needs it will save you big $$ in sizing both solar panels and batteries.",

There will not be another True-Up in July. I oversized my solar system, so I expect I will be a Net Producer on an annual basis. I am just not sure if I will be a Net Producer in the winter months when production is low.

        "comment": "lol Did you even read those?\n\n&gt;\"Without the huge government subsidies for fossil fuels, wouldn’t they be eclipsed by renewables? The answer, for now, is no. So far renewables just can’t provide enough fuel and power to displace fossil fuels. The infrastructure to make and distribute them isn’t adequate, and many renewables have shortcomings that can make them difficult to work with–solar panels, for example, only generate electricity when the sun is out. If the fossil fuel subsidies disappear, gasoline and electricity prices will increase. That will help renewables compete, and increase in scale, but it will take years–likely decades–for them to reach levels high enough to replace all fossil fuels.\"\n\nSo why are you pretending like this is a done deal and happening right now?\n\nThe second one...\n\n&gt;\"Success this year was driven largely by the utility-scale segment, which was bolstered by a pipeline of projects initially hedging against the extension of the federal Investment Tax Credit.\"\n\nWhy does there need to be huge tax credits to motivate people to get something, if it's already succeeding under normal market practices?\n\nI can play the link game too...\n\nIvanpah Solar Plant Burning Gas... http://www.pe.com/2017/01/23/ivanpah-solar-plant-built-to-limit-greenhouse-gases-is-burning-more-natural-gas/\n\nIvanpah May be Forced to Shut Down... https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivanpah-solar-plant-may-be-forced-to-shut-down-1458170858\n\nIvanpah asks for bailout... http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/google-asks-bailout-federally-funded-solar-plant/\n\nIvanpah kills 6000 birds a year... http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-solar-bird-deaths-20160831-snap-story.html\n\nIf a single oil related facility killed 6000 birds a year, people would be losing their shit over it.\n\nYou're also comparing apples and oranges. Any subsidies there might be to fossil fuel, covers way more things than solar and wind does. All you're talking about with that is electricity. Fossil fuel covers that AND trucks, ships, planes... and way more. So why are you acting like it's all the same exact thing? There's tons of electric cars. Nobody buys them. What are you going to do, put a gun to people's head and force them to buy something they don't like? Or maybe you expect taxpayers to buy cars for people too?",

However, if we crack that, it would be nice since sunshine is more predictable.  In a way there's potential here since in the modern world people are going to concentrate more in cities, leaving the countryside empty.  Farming for food is just another way to get energy from the sun, so in a world with an extreme population it's not impossible for farm land to be solar panels getting more energy out of the sun that plants would, where a portion of the energy is then used in more efficient industrial food production, e.g. light for plants.",

        "comment": "The dirtiest coal when burned generates 2lbs of CO2 for every kWh generated. A gallon of gas creates 19.7 lbs of CO2 when burned.\n\nSo, here's your homework: find out the carbon footprint of your energy company (some coal is cleaner than others, most energy companies use a variety of sources like wind, solar, hydro, natural gas), divide 19.7 by your car's mpg (to get lbs of CO2 per mile), and then divide your energy provider's CO2/kWh by the EV you want to buy's mi/kWh.\n\nExample: my energy company produces .8lbs of CO2 per kWh delivered to my home. My EV averages 4.9mi/kWh. So my EV's CO2/mile is about 0.16 lbs CO2/mile. The average light duty vehicle in the U.S. gets 25 mpg, so produces 0.8 lbs CO2/mile.\n\n\nEdit: totally missed where you were going with your question. Leaving this anyway.",

        "comment": "let's see... 1600 + (215*6) = 2890 watts... and that's just nameplate... the wind turbine is a l'il wonky to fit in like this, and my sales and financial experience with them is a quite limited..  so at $4600 you're looking at $1.59 watt.  now, that's just materials... and you also have to think about install.  If you're doing it yourself, that's good, and not terribly difficult to DIY on the solar end, especially if you're building the house as you go.  an installed solar array of 2800 watts'll cost you somewehre in the neighborhood of $3.15 -$3.50 a watt.  and a lot of that is in fact labor.  so you're right on track.\n\nI do have one major concern, though, and that is the state of the batteries.  batteries don't really \"sit around\" well, and if they've been in storage for too long at all, you're going to need new ones.... and i mean they'll lose charge within a month, month and a half, and essentially ruin the battery.  and batteries ain't cheap.  couple hundred a piece... definitely ask to put a meter on them before you hand money over, and if they are just reading ~6V, then they're toast, and  you can dicker the price down quite a bit.  Do some research on battery voltage ratings and estimations and life span for a 6v deep cycle battery\n\nyou may want to consider calling outback, flexmax, and xantrex, and seeign what kind of support is still offered on those products... \n\nalso, on the wind turbine... that can be difficult to DIY a solid tower-raising... you may want to ask around your local 'wind turbine clubs', and see if you can find someone who's raised a few.  it is an odd task, so as much hands on experience as you can find for the day will pay off in spades.  \n\nGood luck!",

        "comment": "Well, to actually answer your questions - \n\nA)  how much would it cost? - Average price for a grid tie right now is about $3.15, depending on local rebates and the like.  Average size on a home is 6kW, so you're looking at ballpark $19grand before rebates.  Depending on your consumption, you can still, very likely, put a decent dent in your bill even if you drop down to a 3.5 or 4k.\n\nB)  How many watts will it produce - Wrong unit, but the answer won't change - that depends on a lot.  Azimuth and tilt angle and latitude drive the better part of those equation.  \n\nC)  You have a misunderstanding about grid-tie vs. battery backups.  $3.15 covers basic grid ties, where your production directly counters your consumption at the utility bill.  However, the equipmetn is designed so that if the grid goes down, your equipment goes down and you don't push solar back on to the grid.  (this is called anti-islanding, and is a required safety protocol).  In order to operate a dedicated loads panel (your fridges, water pump etc. etc.) you need to incorporate a battery bank, which wildly changes the scope and costs of the job.\n\nD)  not enough money to rig the house itself up....  Again, you have a basic misunderstanding of what happens in a solar array and your electrical service.  No insult intended, but you're just at the very beginning of this conversation. \n\nE)  Call a few Installers in your area and have them run some numbers and do some practical education for you.  Or ask more questions here.",

I'm fine with coal being used to generate electricity, but only when it's done in a responsible and environmentally clean way (which I'm not sure exists today, but I'm not an expert in coal).  I'd much rather see more nuclear plants than coal plants, but with the current wave of FUD, it's not likely that will happen.  Ultimately, I see Solar Power as the future and the more we invest in Solar Energy research and development, the better off we'll be as a nation.  Solar is the long game where we reap the benefits 25, 50, or 100 years from now by having to spend less cleaning up the mess we've created.",

        "comment": "I am glad the article mentioned the dubious solar freaking roadways project, but rooftop and covered spaces are still the low hanging fruit with fast payback. \n\nSolar panels on the ground where people are traveling really aren't where we should be heavily investing.  Most walkways are between buildings or surrounded by trees, so the sun exposure is spotty at best.  They are also flat on the ground, so their yearly output is horribly optimized.  Peak use by people also directly coincides with peak solar hours, so that also seems to be an issue.\n\nI think it would be cool to see on tennis and basketball courts though.  They generally have full exposure to sun and are not close to dirt or other forms of debris that would otherwise cover the panels.  There are also a limited number of people on the court at a time, so that cuts down on the partial shade issue.",

And very few companies are both racking manufacturers and installers. \nUsually it's a racking company that will make an install manual, that covers everything to do with their companies product, and leave the safety etc up to the installer.  It's much safer legally speaking to just say \"use your company specific safety and training procedures.\"\nSource: I write the technical content for the install manual for a solar racking company. \n\nLarger companies like SolarCity, Vivant, Sunrun etc have combined manuals but like Frank said, they aren't public. \n\nThe one you linked looks like an internal training document for explaining how to check a system once installed, but doesn't detail install instructions. \n\nGet the install manual for whichever racking company you're using and go from there IMO.",

If you are interested in the project, you should contact her, you find contact inforamtion on the web page of the project: \nhttp://www.sv.uio.no/iss/english/research/projects/solar-transitions/index.html\n\nI wrote my master thesis about these power plants as well! I agree, they are very interesting models for rural electrification, and this research project \"solar transitions\" has a very interesting way of making researchers and practitioners meet and share information and learn from eachoter to find new and better solutions.\n \nThe solar transitions project is planning to start a rural decentralized power plant in rural Kenya, and as far as I know, are they still struggelig for funding. Solar power is still, unfortunately, still expensive and the main stream development thinking still don't regard such small scale solutions as \"worth it.\" \n\nMy supervisor is really engaged in her project, though, so I know she herself has saved some money, and applied to different institutions for funding, with varying luck. \n\nI guess the Indian governmet are giving more and more attention and funding to this kind of funding. \n\nIf you have any questions about this, feel free to ask!:) Greate that you find it interesting and I am very happy to share!",

Regulation can make fossil fuels more expensive or harder to get, sure, but passing a law doesn't materialize windmills or solar panels out of thin air. Those things have to be physically constructed, installed, and maintained. We can use something like a carbon tax to subsidize green energy by making fossil fuels more expensive but this still relies on the engine of personal choice responding to incentive. \n\nMy personal choice to eat lentils doesn't change the \"entire grid\" of factory farming, either, but we all agree that these choices matter and that it pushes the world in the direction of change. Why is it any different with energy? It's choices all the way down. Passing the buck just keeps us at the status quo.",

        "comment": "&gt; Mega-upvote. Batteries are damned expensive.\n\nNot exactly. With good insulation, gas cooking / heating, solar hot water with gas / heat pump boost you can get daily usage down to 6kWh or less. That then means you only need around 12kWh dependence. Between 8 or 10 * 12v 150AH batteries will do that giving you an 80% cycle. You can get those for $350 (+/-) each, so it's about the same as the solar panels, $roughly $4500. \n\nAdded. With LED lights (6W each) and sound practices like leaving 1 on as a lamp and turn on down-lights only when required, or having 2 on to watch TV on low demand flat screen. Using a laptop as the main PC and the Tower only when you really need so much grunt. You can bring the usage down to 4.5kWh a day. \n\nIts not always getting the kit that suits your habbits. It's often changing your habits that can allow you save lots on your kit. Either way, a change in habit and \"how you get things done\" will over a lifetime save you as much or more than $100,000 on energy costs over a lifetime. That number is what the average house will spend on energy at today's prices over 40 years or so. So really, are batteries that expensive when you look at 40 / 50 years of energy + the cost of replacing worn batteries. As it is today, with a change of attitude, a change of habits and living with the limitations you can spend more time on a beach in say, Vietnam? Than  sending some executive CEO pocket change for his million dollar yacht. \n\nTo go further - have separate batteries for lighting - on a dedicated low voltage circuit. Then you sine wave the big users like power points / fridge / blower fans etc. You can run a standard LED down-light on 4AAA batteries for days.",

I'm installing solar panels for 11 years in California and we do a lot of service calls for other companies and we never changed solar modules because the module failed, you don't need premium panels just if you have limited roof space. Go for any brand name solar modules with SolarEdge and you will be in great hands. \nGo for local installer you will get a better deal.",

I choose not to use REF for two reasons, 1- I did not want to wait and chance not getting it since its limited and you must qualify and miss out on the full 30% tax credit.  2- REF is for net metering only, I preffered the REG program which I'm contracted for 15 years to sell 100% of my generated power at .2845 per kwh. With REG NG pays out cash for the difference (generation value - usage cost) each month direct deposit.",

        "comment": "So close to being accurate, a B for effort.\n\nFrom an electric reliability standpoint, spinning reserves are synced to the grid, but aren't producing at their full capacity (some nuance there, but think of a car doing 5mph that can increase to 60mph whenever).  These are roughly 3% of demand.\n\nNon-spinning reserves are able to be dispatched within ten-minutes and increase at a certain output over time until hitting their target (think of a car that needs to be started and warmed up before leaving the driveway). These are also roughly 3% of demand.\n\nThen there is frequency response, which is generally the immediate response of the inertia of a generator to keep the grid at 60hz (think cruise-control).\n\nAnd then there are fuel reserves, i.e. water behind a dam, coal in a big pile, natural gas in a pipeline or storage facility, which are required to provide any of the above (think gas in your tank). This is where wind and solar (but not geothermal) generally cause issues due to the variability of fuel supply, though battery storage is getting better and can help a bit, as can demand side management (think turning off your AC when driving up a mountain). \n\nAnd then there is something called a planning reserve margin, which is what regulators use to make sure utilities and grid operators can keep the lights on; it's usually in the 105-115% of forecasted peak demand range, and there's a complex way of figuring out what you have to have to show you have enough, including significant discounting for renewables due to the fuel supply issue (think your wife telling you to keep the tank over half full during the winter, vs. driving around on E and hoping there are plenty of stations).\n\nI'll stop there, but we could also discuss the transmission system, line losses, voltage support, contingency planning, demand forecasting, and on and on.\n\nTL;DR - your local electric utility provides an incredibly complex service to keep your lights on, \"buy some solar panels\" only works if you're willing to be in the dark on occasion and don't care if your grocery store, hospital, or internet provider is too.. If you want modern life, you have to use a shit-ton of energy. \n\nPro-tip #1 - Google: \"[your electric company] and integrated resource plan\". Most will have some layman's guide to all this. Ex. https://www.psegliny.com/page.cfm/AboutUs/CurrentInitiatives/IRP\n\nPro-Tip #2: go vegan, it doesn't solve everything, but it's a great first step.",

Tesla won't install a solar panels in the house it has a substandard electrical system. I think that the preliminary thing to do is get an electrician in there probably sort out the problems you discussed. Also, Tesla won't install the solar panels on the roof that's more than 10 years old (shingles).  So it sounds like you're pretty far away from installing any solar. I consider anything that we put into our house to upgrade it it's a better investment than having it sit in a bank.  In any event, It sure is convenient to have electricity just switch right over without even knowing it when there's a blackout!",

What if \"data\" is just cherry-picking, a kind of mass-hallucination based on an agreement about how to continue getting paid for doing work that does nothing to grease the wheels of business? They just want their comfy lower middle class lifestyles while making the rest of us feel bad for being real, free Americans.  And it's creeping communism, even if they don't know it.  As soon as you say \"society\" or \"responsibility\" or \"global catastrophe\" you're sliding towards the Stalinist abyss. The only way to keep us safe is to keep that great engine of manifest destiny unhindered in any way. That must be our lodestone, our guiding star. THe shining city on the hill will not be uglified with solar panels.  If Reagan taught us anything he taught us that. \n\nAnyway, you have to look at the data directly to understand it. Make your own record sets, pick your own start and end dates. Otherwise you're just being duped by the greatest lies of all -- statistics and theories.  Don't listen to those who invoke \"peer review\" and claim \"consensus\".  Find anomalies and fight for a new scientific revolution, a return to the halcyon days of America, when no one ever had to consider the Sun or carbon or any of that shrill liberal stuff. \n\nIt is morning in America, and the horizon is lit with fracking fires, not with sunlight, and that how it aught to be.",

Do they cost about the same?\n\n&gt;In a PERC solar panel, the light that makes it to the bottom of the solar panel is concentrated\n\nHow is the light concentrated? Is more light being reflected back than hits the rear of a panel normally?  Is the rear reflective material somehow acting like a sunlight magnet?\n\n&gt;A standard silicon solar cell uses a portion of the light passing through it to create electrons. It can and achieve an efficiency of up to 18 percent.  ...increases the efficiency to 20 percent without a significant increase in cost.\n\nAren't normal panel cells up to around 22% efficiency?  Do PERCs increase the efficiency 10% or 20%? Both numbers are used in the article.",

Not only does the Lightning include the 2.4-kW system and eight outlets, but an optional 9.6-kW system ups the count to 11 120-volt outlets and a 240-volt outlet. With between 98 kWh and 131 kWh of power stored in a fully charged battery pack, it's like having seven to nine Tesla Powerwall home batteries sitting in your garage.

It's just a transmission wire and inverters or a gas pipeline.  Gonna have to ask you for some evidence for the wholesale pessimism. \n\n&gt;Solar PV generates for 1/4th of the day. \n\nThe point I've made repeatedly is that the price and quality of batteries is plunging at exponential, law of accelerating returns, rates in parallel with solar.  Right now you can buy a battery and panel setup to power your home 24 hrs per day.  In the very near future this will only get cheaper and easier.\n\nSmells like the can't-do attitude of a nuke fanboy.  Minor tech issues regarding solar are impossible to solve, while Rube Goldberg boiling of molten throium/uranium salt is just peachy.  Maybe you're not one of those, but singing the same tune.",

        "comment": "Based on my experiences doing something similar, here is the best advice I can recommend:\n\n1) Save up $20k\n\n2) While doing this, learn basic micro-inverter solar array design. You will learn how to specify all balance of system material in step 3a.\n\n3) Use the $20k to buy, install, own, and lease about 10kW of solar arrays to friends/family, likely divided between two project sites.\n\n3a) Hire an hourly roofer and electrician to help you through the final design and installation process. Roofers know roof work. Electricians know electrical work. Provided you know enough about basic array design, they'll be able to help you the rest of the way through the projects.\n\n3b) Structure the lease of the array as a 20 year operating lease, with the lease price set to ~20% below the retail price of electricity. Require a 30% down payment, which is recovered when the leasee files their taxes. As such, the leasee will start saving money as soon as they file their taxes. At an \"install price\" of $5/W, you'll get $1.50/W back as the downpayment, which should recover around 15k of your $20k investment back.\n\n3c) Recover the remaining $5k back in roughly 2 years via depreciation + lease payments. Without including depreciation, it'll take 4 years without any state/local incentives (which in PA are not worth pursuing).\n\n3d) You still have 17 years left to profit off the solar lease, cheers!\n\n4) Use your new found skills to offer hourly solar design services to architecture firms to achieve immediate cash flow and potential clients.\n \nProvide hourly field supervisory services to their electrician / roofer of choice, having a \"preferred\" installation contractor if there is no preference.\n\nYou can use this method to win your first commercial projects to boot!\n\n5) Also, sell solar arrays turnkey for $5/W, and solar lease additional arrays where your profits allow.",

        "comment": "Not a marketer for SunPower, to be clear. But it would be my guess there are at least three things that are at play: high rates simply give more room for premium components; appearance matters in some upscale metropolitan communities (black may be more acceptable, e.g.); and some states (NY, CT, MA) have policies aimed to make it easier for a wider range of people to invest. Those of \"moderate means\" may have smaller houses with limited space.\n\nEspecially in the NYC Burroughs, Westchester, Fairfield/New Haven CT areas, and northern NJ, the installed costs are typically higher than the median for the U.S. ($/home and $/watt). I haven't seen a perfect breakdown of what impacts the costs, but some studies crudely isolated system size and premium components. When looking at Long Island market, system sizes were on average about 25% larger than the rest of the state, including Westchester, for example. Those same homeowners are likely to choose top of the line cabinets and appliances for a kitchen remodel, perhaps, so why not premium solar components? Especially since L.I. is often second only to places in Hawaii for energy rates.",

        "comment": "Sunrun is one of the worst companies to deal with. I guarantee the sales person is lying to you. \n\nThe tax credit is yours. It doesn’t matter what size your system is and it doesn’t matter if the credit is 1000 dollars or one million dollars. Size plays zero role in it. It’s not a hassle any decent tax prepper understands the credit. Depending on what state you are in there could be state benefits and energy credits they aren’t telling you about as well. \n\nGoogle sunrun. Look for lawsuits, bbb complaints, consumer reports, etc. If you don’t ghost this sales person after this you get what’s coming to you. \n\nOne of the neat sales tricks sunrun will employ is selling you an undersized system intentionally. They then build the system with expansion in mind so it’s incredibly easy to just add on to it later on down the road. I very recently saw a sun run system where their original system wasn’t operating so the customer complained. Instead of performing corrective maintenance on the old system they referred them to sales to sell them an add on. They are also notorious for preying on the elderly. \n\nTheir customer service is crap. Service takes forever. If your inverter goes out it may take them 3 months to get it replaced. Meanwhile you are paying them and your electric bill. \n\nI easily speak with 400-500 sunrun customers every year post sale and none of them are happy and there isn’t shit they can do about it. I’m at the point where I’ve lost all empathy for lease customers. The information is readily available for you to make an informed decision and most of them never read their contract to begin with. At the very most you can save 20% on your energy costs with a lease. You can save 20% on your energy costs by simply changing energy use habits, maybe upgrading an appliance or two, etc. \n\nI can go on and on about this. I understand every angle and the bottom line is this company doesn’t exist without the tax credit in play. It’s the core of their business model. It’s the ugly side of the industry i work in and happen to love.\n\nTL;DR Ghost this company",

One was definitely predatory (pushy, downplayed facts, etc.), while the other just didn't want to give me a quote because I wanted batteries as well. Unfortunately, a lot of people just live in areas where all of the solar installers are scams. Here in Oregon, the state solar incentives only go to the installers, which the consumers rarely ever see reflected in their price.",

I'm looking at my PG&amp;E net metering data for past several months and I'm wondering if it looks reasonable. This is the generated kwh\n\nWhat seems odd to me is the steep drop off in December. The gradual decline in fall seems smooth, but Nov to Dec seems too big?\n\nDec: 77\n\nNov: 220\n\nOct: 293\n\nSept: 260\n\nAug: 409\n\nJuly: 490\n\nJune: 526\n\nMay: 515\n\nSecond question: My current True-Up is $165 and I have 2 more cold months remaining in annual cycle. So I'm guessing it will be an annual True-Up in the $200-$300 range.\n\nI currently have 16 panels, so that means each panel is 262 Watts (250?)\n\nIf I add say 4 more then that would increase output by 25% and by my calculations cut my True-Up in 1/2. Does it make sense to add more panels to try to reduce my annual net usage? Is there anything wrong with having higher negative net usage in summer months? In May before the CA fires, I saw peak negative net usage of 135 kw. I need to check what the rest of my equipment is rated for to understand if it's even possible to simply hire someone to add additional panels to the existing system. I'd likely work with the company that did the initial install.",

        "comment": "It’s time for President Biden to fire his “climate guy”.\n\nThat’s how John Kerry described himself last week at what even CBS News called a “failed” international climate summit in Glasgow.\n\nThe undistinguished former Senator and presidential wannabe said the Communist Chinese’s slave labor to manufacture everything from tennis shoes to solar panels that ship to the United States is “not in his lane”.\n\nAlthough the President has said Beijing is guilty of genocide and current Secretary of State Tony Blinken agrees, Mr. Kerry can’t be bothered by mass arrests, slave labor, and concentration camps where hundreds of thousands of Chinese are tortured by their government.\n\nMr. Kerry, the president’s “Special Envoy for Climate,” like many of today’s progressives, considers climate change an existential threat to the planet and, presumably, to those of us who live on it.\n\nIn their minds, the danger seems to justify totalitarian measures at home and to turn a blind eye to atrocities reminiscent of Nazi atrocities in an earlier era so long as perpetrators will sit down with Mr. Kerry and his various assistants to the problem.\n\nWhether we have a dozen years or a decade before “the end” of the world as we know, it is open to debate within their ranks, but they all agree we should be willing to sacrifice everything to survive.\n\nThat includes not just jobs, living standards, heat during the winter or any possibility of economic growth in third world countries, but that ephemeral freedom for which men and women have fought and died for over the centuries.",

        "comment": "&gt;Which is exactly what US and UK have done so far - they have (successfully) exported CO2 and SO2 pollution to the 3rd world :(\n\nWhich is exactly what many of us said would be the problem with Carbon Dioxide Taxes.  As long as an industry has a place that they can shift production to make something cheaper, they will.  It doesn't really matter if the increased cost comes higher labor costs, higher materials costs or higher taxation - the bottom line is cost of production.\n\nMaking manufacturing more expensive here through carbon taxation won't keep industries from producing goods, it will just force them to shift production away from the developed world, where other environmental controls are stronger.\n\nThis is why I've always argued against a carbon tax; it's not globally applied. One may have as well declared the goal of the carbon tax was to force manufacturing to move to China or India, rather than to reduce carbon emissions worldwide, since that was the obvious result.\n\n&gt;The most obvious problem is that once you factor in all the costs burning fuel to release 10 billion tonnes of CO2 and then ‘sequester’ 1 billion is far more expensive and far, far riskier than to just burn for 9 billion tonnes in the first place\n\nHere, I oddly agree with you.  Sequester is a poor solution, as there are other costs associated with coal and oil that simply using sequester does not address.  Black carbon (soot), fly ash, and other remains from the burning of coal and oil will still pollute the air and water of our world.  Unfortunately, when we start talking about costs, it's still *cheaper* to simply ignore that pollution than to address it. \n\nWe will eventually have to figure out how to move beyond fossil fuels.  It's not \"if\" but \"when.\"  That's a technological answer that won't be solved by taxing carbon or trading shares in carbon emissions.  This world has a LOT of energy coming to it by solar radiation.  We've simply got to figure out better ways of harnessing that energy.  Solar panels that convert 15% of the energy into electricity are not good enough.  Wind turbines are good, but the wind doesn't blow consistently enough to use without a better method of storing the peak energy production to use when the energy draw is at peak.\n\nWhat we really, really need is a better energy storage medium.  After all, that's all coal and oil really are; energy storage.  If we could figure out a cheap way to convert existing atmospheric carbon dioxide back into natural gas, for example, or even into a higher energy liquid fuel like biodiesel, we could have a sustainable, recyclable energy production system that would not pull any more carbon out of the ground.\n\nWhen, not if, the inevitable change from holocene to glaciation period comes, we may reconsider how much atmospheric CO2 we want, if we ever get to a reliable answer on how CO2 affects the climate.  The interglacial period has lasted now for around 12,000 years, which is pretty close to the average total length of an interglacial.  The change to glaciation may not be here for 500 years, but when it does come, we  humans will want to know how to reduce the effects of the change, to maintain as close to optimal conditions as we can manage.\n\nAt that point, we may start calling for some engineered global warming.  That will be an interesting time.  Too bad I'll miss it.",

That is enough to support maybe 2-3 solar panels depending on their amperage. That's not enough to even turn on most reasonably sized inverters. If you plugged 3 kilowatts of panels (approx. 12 panels) through a 3kw inverter and into an outlet, you would overheat the wires, melt the insulation, and trip your breaker. That is the best case. Worst case, if it were romex, it could arc and burn your house down. As a new technology, the burden of proof regarding safety is absolutely on the solar industry, and for good reason.",

        "comment": "This is long, but hear me out here (read it all) if you're truly interested in owning your own system.    \n\n\nThe worse thing you can do, is get a solar system that is way under-rated for the amount of electric you use per month.  I.E.  If you use (just giving example numbers here, for simplicity) 20kwh per month, and your solar system can only provide 2kwh per month... you've spent well more on a system that does almost nothing for you, and you'll never see your ROI.  \n\n\nWe had a system installed in July of '22. (note here: You'll realize later that we didn't start generating electric until late August, almost into September, almost 2 full months)   The previous summer, we had been running litecoin miners, and didn't replace any of our lights with LEDs or anything (gobble gobble, electric yum!)  But we used that as a basis for the amount of electric we use monthly.  We based our solar system on /that/ amount (about 80%, due to available usable roof area)  We then dropped a big chunk for a down payment, to keep the monthly \\*energy\\* bill down, and not spend 30 years financing it.   Our overall energy bill is considerably lower than our previous electric bill.  Our new electric bill is about 30% less than it was, but combine that with the solar loan, and our energy bill is about 60% of our old electric bill.    \n\n\nNow, with that, however, we have replaced a LOT of lighting with LED bulbs and fixtures, replaced our hot water heater with a heatpump model, turned off the miners, and are more concious about turning off TVs, lights, computers (at least sleep mode), and have kept the thermostat set a little higher than we used to.  It all adds up.    \n\n\nWe've generated enough electric the last 2 months to bring our TECO bill down to 15-20% of what it used to be.  Last month, we generated enough to compensate for all but 1075kwh.  If you've paid attention to your electric bill, you have probably noticed that rates are increased after the first 1000kwh.  So, we paid the increased rate for only 75kwh.    \n\n\nOur system is 20kwh /potential/  - meaning on the best days, when we can squeeze every bit of generation from the sun, it can produce 20kw per hour.  about 1/4 of our panels are on the east slope, 1/4 on the west slope, and 1/2 on the south slope (it didn't make financial sense to put any on the north slope)  - We generally get about 15kwh through mid-day, when the sun is directly hitting the east and south, and then the west and south in later mid-day.  When the sun is at solar noon, the efficiency on the west and east slopes is limited.  (My wife just checked for me, and we've generated 11mw (megawatts) since the start of September, just over 4 months)    \n\n\nOur friend, has a much smaller house, smaller family, and has very few electric \\*things\\* in the house - they generally do outside stuff, or crafts to pass the time when not working.  So, their electric bill was only about $150/month.  The small solar system they installed (not sure of specs) cost them about $100/month for the loan. It generates enough electric that their electric bill is somewhere around $40/m  - and most of that is connection fee, taxes, etc.    \n\n\nSome notes about solar in Florida (we're just south of Polk City):  \nif you buy a big enough solar system (I think anything about 15kwh potential?) puts you into a classification where you are considered an electric generating entity - basically the same class as Duke/Teco/FPL for their power plants.  This also means you need you'll need to carry a million dollar personal liability insurance (StateFarm was the only place that would insure for that amount, but it's less than $250/yr) - This isn't required for the two lower classes though, afaik.   \n\n\nYour county will do an inspection.  Your power company will do an inspection.  You will fail for the most stupid of things.  Don't worry about it, just make sure your installer gets onto resolving the issue.  We held part of our downpayment hostage until they resolved our issue (which was that they used vinyl stickers on the cut off box instead of a fastened hard placard. lame, but I digress.)   \n\n\nYou will more than likely deal with 6 different companies, county, and possibly the city.  Your HOA (if you have one) has absolutely no legal teeth to bar you from getting solar installed on your home, nor to tell you where it can and cannot be installed on your home.  Keep that in mind, but you should inform them of work to be done (as a curtesy)   \n\n\nThese are the types of companies you'll be dealing with:  \nSolar engineering company (we used solar. com)   \nInstaller company  \nsolar loan / financing   \ninspection company (needs to inspect your structure to verify it's suitable for the extra weight)  \ninsurance company (either for personal liability, or at least for homeowners insurance)  \nyour electric company (being in Fl, probably Duke, Teco of FPL)  \nand then your county building inspector's office  \nand possibly a city inspector as well.    \nYou'll also need to know the manufacturer of the equipment, if you want to connect their app for monitoring purposes, but this isn't dealing with them on a business relationship level - any issues will go through your installer, even warranty work.    \n\n\nWhen you go to get estimates, and I highly suggest solar. com, tell them you want to your overall energy bills (solar loan + electric) to be less than what you're paying for electric now, and that you want the most potential generation possible for your home.  The third factor should be how much you have for a down.    \n\n\nI believe we put down almost 50% - my wife had a sudden income from her grandfather passing away (ripe old age of 101!!)  So it made sense for us to use it.  We avoided various taxes on it (since he passed away in New York) and got a tax credit by spending it on the solar system.\n\nEven at 10% down, depending on your electric bill, solar loan (which is dictated by size of system and loan length term), you should be able to get your monthly energy bill lower than your current electric bill - even folding into personal liability insurance, if needed.  \n\nKeep in mind, your ROI (Return on Investment, for anyone reading this that don't know)  Ours is about 6 years, which means we will have saved more in that time than what the system cost us over the full length of the loan.   \n\nThe last benefit to getting solar is that when the electric companies increase their rates, your solar loan won't increase.  You'll still be paying more once their rates go up, but no where near as much more as without generating your own electric.  To be clear, the power companies deduct excess generated electric you feed back into the grid from your consumption before billing you.  (if you use 20kw, but generated \\*an excess\\* of 18kw, they'll charge you only for 2kw - it's more complicated than that, but boils down like this)  \n\n\nSome caveats:  \nA solar system by itself cannot be used in a power-out situation.  If you want emergency power from your solar system, you must install batteries (such as Tesla PowerWall)  These act both as a storage medium, as well as a buffering medium so that the electric feeding all your electric and electronic stuff is 110v @ 60hz.  And you'll need to get an automatic cut-off switch installed which prevents your system from feeding power into the grid, for the safety and lives of the linemen.  And even that's a tough one to get passed electric companies in Florida.   \n\n\nThere's two types of solar systems out there - the kind which push DC power from the solar array to your base, which is then converted to AC power; and systems which push AC power to aggregator boxes that then feed your house.  The type of system you get installed will dictate the type of battery system you can use with it.  This is honestly something I wish I had understood before buying the system we have (it uses micro-inverters to push AC to the base)   \n\n\nI think I covered nearly every question you might have, and questions you will eventually have.  I truly hope this helps you with understanding solar ownership.  I don't know much about \"co-op\"/leasing systems, or solar credit schemes the electric companies have, other than you're financially responsible, but don't get the benefits anywhere near as you would with owning your own.  Lots of research there last year, and last thing you want is a lease or co-op system, the second to last is owning a system that's under-rated.",

        "comment": "I assume that amplifier \"12V @4.5A\" is the maximum, that is 12V x 4.5A = 54VA (or Watt) (the original is 24V @ 4.5A = 108 Watt).     \nYour 100Ah deep cycle battery (down to 20%) can deliver 4.5A during (100Ah-20Ah) / 4.5A (max) = 17.7 hours.    \n\nIn your battery link there is:     \n&gt;Frequently Bought Together           \n&gt;Renogy 100 Watts 12 Volts Monocrystalline Solar Panel $149.99      \n\nDon't forget the charge controller, and fuse in the battery wiring.   \nIt depends on how clear the sky is, the temperature, and which way the panel is pointing, but I sort of expect it can deliver (on average) about 5A during 5 hours, another 25Ah or (25Ah / 4.5A = ) 5.5 hours for the battery/amplifier.      \n\nIf you start with a full battery and 1 panel, you can play music for 24 hours, but then the battery is empty, not good.     \n\nWith 2 of those panels in parallel you get 10A during 5(?) hours, 4.5A for the amplifier directly, and 5.5A to charge the battery (about 6 hours worth of music after sundown, but you'll have to wait till 10:00-ish before the battery is charged enough to start playing again, but that 5.5A will only charge the battery an extra 5.5A x 5 hr = 27.5Ah, about a quarter of the needed capacity, next evening after 3-4 hours you are SOL).      \n\nWith 3 panels you get 15A, 10.5A x 5 hr = 52.5Ah recharge, or about half the battery capacity.      \n\nUsing 12V has a few advantages.     \nYour car battery normally lasts ~5 years, then it can't deliver the high starting current anymore, but a few amperes for a stereo should be no problem, your local garage might have some 'old' ones you can borrow before they are recycled (or convince all your family/friends they need a new car battery NOW).     \nWhen you connect them in parallel, capacity (Ah) doesn't matter, just connect the 'minuses' together, and use a 12V (headlamp) bulb between the 'plusses' to equalize the voltages.    \n\nOccasionally by the sound of it, (at least) 100W is 'normal' for a car stereo, those are already 12V, your local garage/car-shop might have the amplifier you need (depends on the source and plug-type of your music, speakers, etc).       \n\nSolar panels blow over very easy, possibly damaging them, for a single panel you need a lot of ballast (and the proper frame for it), if you take 2 panels (electrically connected in parallel) and mount them in an [East-West](http://www.westlandsolar.nl/media/wysiwyg/oost-west_1_westlandsolar.jpg) setup, then it's more stable (but you do need to make/buy a frame for that).     \n  \nYour original SMSL-SA60 is about 100W max, if you only need 50W, the batteries will last about twice as long, if you visit or google-fu the car-stereo shop, you might find out (or ask) what the real energy requirements are.",

The first solar controller to start charging will raise the voltage and the second one will notice it's charging and not charge. \n\nYou'll want to just connect all the panels in parallel (likely) and run all your power through one solar charge controller. \n\nMake sure all your batteries are tested for proper function - one bad battery will pull down your whole system and make your batteries fail faster. \n\nConnecting the solar should go across the battery bank - google how to connect it properly. \n\nAlso why exactly do you need to monitor the solar panels or export the stats?

        "comment": "I'm the author. First, thanks for linking to my article. So, to answer a few points. The insect study was deeply flawed. The reason they only have honeybees for China is not because nobody in China is researching into insect populations there. It was because the authors did a non systematic search of the literature which mainly turned up results in the US and Europe. They should not have used honey bees for China. If you are doing a survey of wild mammals in Australia would you include a data point for pigs? There were experts on twitter immediately pointing out the many flaws with this study but the media didn't notice what they said. They also did a search with \"DECLIN\\*\" as one of the required search terms, which their critics say may have biased the results towards articles about declining populations of insects.\n\nThe FAO a week or two afterwards released a report involving reports from countries worldwide that found no consistent pattern in pollinators of crops worldwide. Some increase, some decrease, some mixed, some level. The only consistent pattern was a reduction of insect numbers in livestock grazed pastureland.\n\nThere are also many projects underway worldwide to preserve insect biodiversity and pollinators and these have lead to increases in insects for instance in Nepal and due to the flower rich field margins project in Europe etc. It is the biodiversity of the insects that matters more than the numbers. For instance if you have a large variety of pollinators then you get higher crop yields than if you have only the domestic honey bee to pollinate your crop\n\nFor details of the many issues with this study see\n\n[We Are NOT Headed For World Without Insects - Insect Decline Survey  Hitting Headlines Non Systematic, Patchy &amp; With Limited Data](https://www.science20.com/robert_walker/we_are_not_headed_for_world_without_insects_insect_decline_survey_hitting_headlines_non_systematic_patchy_with)\n\nI go into the FAO report here (this was widely misreported in the media)\n\n[UN  report is far from bleak - an encouraging survey of measures being used  to preserve biodiversity - many knowledge gaps and issues but also much  we can do](https://www.quora.com/q/duzzmyeobxjljrpq/UN-report-is-far-from-bleak-an-encouraging-survey-of-measures-being-used-to-preserve-biodiversity-many-knowledge-gap)\n\nAnother similar one was the report about Puerto Rico rainforest losing insects at an alarming rate in 2017 that turned out to be because the first datapoint was taken just after Hurricane Harvey which by blowing down trees created a local short lived boom in insects\n\n[OOPS - Purto Rican insects in the forest canopy increase with warmth - not decline - and frogs like the warmth too](https://www.quora.com/q/duzzmyeobxjljrpq/OOPS-Purto-Rican-insects-in-the-forest-canopy-increase-with-warmth-not-decline-and-frogs-like-the-warmth-too)\n\nThe media do not issue corrections for these reports. I did not find anyone else even reporting that new Puerto Rico study and mine is still the only news story on the topic in Google News to say they got it wrong.\n\n[Google search for Puerto Rico insects](https://www.google.com/search?q=puerto+rico+insects)\n\nThe German study is the only one of all those that is actually good science and correct.\n\nThey did see a decline in insects, but not due to global warming. In northern latitudes like Germany you expect warming to increase insect numbers (it can cause reductions if it leads to drier conditions but for the time being the projections are for longer growing seasons and wetter winters and more soil moisture).\n\n* [Debunked: No the German research doesn’t mean that we face an “insect apocalypse”](https://www.quora.com/q/duzzmyeobxjljrpq/Debunked-No-the-German-research-doesn-t-mean-that-we-face-an-insect-apocalypse)\n\nThe FAO mention the German study, and that Germany has started an  Action Programme for Insect Protection which is here (you can use google  translate to see it in English): [Insektenschutz](https://www.bmu.de/insektenschutz/)\n\nThe emissions are expected to stay level or increase on all the scenarios for the next few years. This is because China and India and many other countries are rapidly industrializing. For a few more years they will be using coal to power this industrialization.\n\nBut China already has the largest solar power plants on the planet and it is going to transition from coal to renewables as fast as it can. It had to build up the industry first, and then you have the rapid reductions in the costs of solar panels. It has said it will significantly increase its pledges in 2020, and we have 2025 and 2030 for all the countries to increase their pledges further.\n\n[Yes  emissions are expected to rise or stay the same for a while on all  scenarios - Yes we are able to ramp down to zero emissions](https://debunkingdoomsday.quora.com/Yes-emissions-are-expected-to-rise-or-stay-the-same-for-a-while-on-all-scenarios-Yes-we-are-able-to-ramp-down-to-ze)\n\n[China to Increase 2020 Climate Pledges, Support Green Climate fund- Maintain Biodiversity &amp; May Peak Emissions Early 2020s](https://www.quora.com/q/duzzmyeobxjljrpq/China-to-Increase-2020-Climate-Pledges-Support-Green-Climate-fund-Maintain-Biodiversity-May-Peak-Emissions-Early-202)\n\nThe coal fired power stations they are building now will not be used to capacity or not for the expected lifetime of a power station, but it still made sense to build them because the technology exists. They can also be converted to carbon capture and storage but that is expensive and most likely they are used under capacity to ease the transition while they build the new renewables based power stations which can produce clean energy at a lower cost than coal.\n\nI go into that in\n\n[New study does NOT conclude that we have too many fossil fuel power plants and vehicles to stay within 1.5°C](https://debunkingdoomsday.quora.com/New-study-does-NOT-conclude-that-we-have-too-many-fossil-fuel-power-plants-and-vehicles-to-stay-within-1-5-C)\n\nOn the Greenland melt, this is actually on track to be slightly less of a melt than for 2012. It is still likely an effect of climate change, events like this should happen somewhere between every 82 years and every 250 years without climate change. We have had two such events only 7 years apart.\n\nBut it is actually not the melt that is the long term issue for Greenland. The main issue for our century is the glacier discharge. The glaciers in North and NE Greenland are buttressed by the sea ice around Greenland. If that all melts they will flow faster.\n\nOf the 15 mm sea level rise so far since 1972 due to Greenland ice loss, 10 mm is from glacier discharge and 5 mm from melt. It lost 8 mm in the last decade, about half each from ice melt and from glacial discharge. But on the long term prospects a recent study says\n\n&gt;The evolution of NO and NE glaciers in the coming decades is therefore  of greatest relevance to future sea level change as the ice shelves are  weakened by climate change.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;…  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the future, we expect the mass changes in the northern part of  Greenland to become of greatest importance to sea level rise, because of  the large reserve of ice above sea level and the potential for manyfold  increase in ice discharge. \n\n [2019 Greenland Melt Not Likely To Beat 2012 Record - 0.5 Mm Sea Rise Ice Melt Is Dramatic, But Glacier Flow Is Long Term Issue](https://www.science20.com/robert_walker/2019_greenland_melt_not_likely_to_beat_2012_record_05_mm_sea_rise_ice_melt_is_dramatic_but_glacier_flow_is_long) \n\nTrump is trying to promote the coal industry but he is not succeeding in increasing CO2 emissions from the US. Its emissions are slowly declining. California already has a target of 100 percent zero emission power generation by 2045. Solar power is competitive with coal to the extent it makes more commercial sense to build new solar than coal power stations in the US. It is rapidly decommissioning coal fired power stations, [546 decomissioned so far since 2010](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=40212). Some convert to gas which produces less CO2 emissions per GW. \n\nI have another article not yet added to my own website but can do so soon, which goes into some of the more recent developments more as well as countering the media narrative that we have only 12 years (or 18 months) to save the planet which is not in the IPCC report or any of the major respectable scientific reports.\n\n [No Scientific Cliff Edge Of 12 Years To Save Planet (or 18 Months) - Can IPCC Challenge 'Deadlines Make Headlines' Misreporting?](https://www.science20.com/robert_walker/no_scientific_cliff_edge_of_12_years_to_save_planet_or_18_months_can_ipcc_challenge_deadlines_make_headlines)",

But I looked at the numbers and it was close, IF you're getting a whole new roof anyway.\n\nLooks like you need about 6-7kW system? For a 6.2kW system in a 3700 SQ ft roof, Tesla's online estimator is spitting out about $38.4k before incentives. And you get a very snazzy high end durable glass tile roof.  Price Will be different depending on your roof size. You pay two different prices for the tiles: blanks and PV. They only put in the amount of PV tiles you need. \n\nGo play around with with their online estimator. Yes they send someone out to do an in person design and quote. But the estimator gets you pretty close.\nNo I don't work for them. Just a fan. I will gladly give you my referral code though if you choose them! 😁\n\nEdit: they are not in micro inverters, they are on a string with delta inverters.\nHere's a good overview\nhttps://cleantechnica.com/2019/08/08/an-inside-look-at-the-components-that-go-into-a-tesla-solar-roof-installation/amp/",

Govt subsidizes and therefore gives cheap energy to people who can afford the install, this is at the cost of overall higher electricity prices and/or taxes. Overall higher energy prices hurt everyone except the lucky few.\n\nEDIT\n\nand/or taxes",

Presumably that's underground where losses are half as much as in the air since larger gauges can be used because weight is not a factor.  The lines would probably have to be that long since it's unlikely that they'd be run in the shortest distance.  So maybe it could work.  Maybe not quite yet, but it should be feasible when production solar panels achieve the efficiencies seen in the lab.  Let's hope it gets there.  Good idea.",

        "comment": "Yes but even when fossil fuel driven grid it can still have a big impact converting to an EV.  It is complicated because it isn't as simple as you are framing it.   Operationally an EV will use far less energy to drive per mile/KM then a gas powered car.  So even when charged from a grid that uses lots of fossil fuels it can result in considerably less CO2 emitted for the EV driven.  So lets say that this standard grid is 35 percent coal and 35 percent natural gas and then 30 percent nonrenewable.    Based on IPCCs numbers this would roughly work out to about 350 grams of CO2 per kWh produced (this is somewhat similar to Germany's grid).   So an EV driven 20,000 kms a year will use 3333 kWhs if it gets 6 kms per kWh efficiency.    This means the EV driven there would emit 2572 pounds of CO2.   A gas car driven the same distance and that gets 8L per 100 kms will use 1600 liters of fuel emitting 10,400 pounds of CO2 (5.1 pounds per liter burned and another 1.4 pounds to extract, refine, transport oil and gas).  So the EV on that grid would produce 4 times less CO2 per year in operation.   Another way to look at it.   You could drive 4 EVs to end of life for the same operational footprint as the one gas powered car.     And this ignores that fact that most grids are getting cleaner over time.  A gas car bought now will always produced the same CO2.   An EV purchased now will see decreasing CO2 released from operation over it's life.   Or the owner can put up rooftop solar to charge it if they want.   So in almost every case if you are going to buy an car you are much better to buy an EV then a gas powered car.",

        "comment": "You don't really refute any of my points. \n\nSolar companies are going to be pursuing the most cost-effective methods for widespread adoption of their products and to compete with other companies that are trying to capture the most market share with the most efficient and reliable products. Space is an important factor due to materials/rooftop limitations etc., it does not just apply to satellite applications alone. Obviously we are not in orbit...the point was that solar cells integrating transfer methods to collect heat energy not absorbed by the cell will either a) cool the solar cell and make it more efficient as a result of the cell running at a lower temperature b) use the resulting hot liquid to heat water in a storage tank, which can be used for the hot water demands of a building c) produce more efficient and cost-effecting energy overall than a double/triple junction cell, which is more expensive. It would be great it we could just make the most efficient panels possible, but that is very very expensive, regardless of where the panels are eventually placed.\n\nSnow and rime would form on solar cells regardless of whether they are in a vacuum tube or not.\n\nThe vast majority of solar panels on the market are Si-based (Cd-Te and CIGS are the only other contenders, but they are marginal), so dealing with lower temperatures to promote efficiency is a priority for everyone interested in solar. Why does harvesting the energy in an evaporated tube negate most of the advantages of cooling?\n\nReiterating: The advantages of BIPV come into play when putting solar on a building during the construction stages. You can save marginal installation costs this way. I don't understand if you disagreeing with me here or not. I agree that BIPV makes sense in some situations as compared to installing a solar system at a future time, but really only when approaching a project during a certain time frame when you have the benefit of being able to work them into the construction. BIPV on the side of building does not produce much electricity compared to the cost and while may seem cool, isn't very practical at all.\n\nThat last point is totally ridiculous. Solar panels are very heavy when you incorporate an entire system onto a roof regardless if they are BIPV or a rack-mounted system installed well after construction of the main building. Most roofs were not designed to withstand all of that extra weight when they were first built, and were only designed to withstand the weight of HVAC units as well as the occasional maintenance crew. That in no way means they are unsuitable or should be 'condemned' if they cannot hold a solar system safely, it just means that the roof was designed with certain weight restrictions without a future solar system in mind.",

The problem is getting that power to people. If we connected the world's grids together we could chase the sun around the day",

I didn't ever say that there aren't other factors, only that it is ridiculous to say that progress in research and development did not contribute to the fall in prices.\n\nYour point about efficiency and process of solar PV being the same since the 70s is simply laughable. For good measure, I've got another graph for you [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PVeff%28rev120404%29.jpg). As you can see, there has been steady and significant progress in *all* technologies: thin-film, mono-crystalline, poly-crystalline and so on. Industry lags behind those research efforts of course, but not by long.\n\n&gt; Read the comment history. For someone who claims to be so smart, you aren't.\n\nI started this particular thread, right? And I was talking about electricity, as should be easily clear from my original comment, or indeed from e.g. [this article](http://www.spiegel.de/international/crossing-the-20-percent-mark-green-energy-use-jumps-in-germany-a-783314.html) I linked you to only 5 posts ago.

New York is okay and that's pretty much it as far as the good deals go that I know of. They do not benefit renters because the participation costs are paid upfront and you get paid back over a looooong time. The model only works because the buy-in costs for participation are fairly cheap and alot of people want to help.\n\nIf you would like to be more directly involved in real community solar, consider buying SRECs from local array owners. Local SRECs start at around $0.04/kWh and go down with volume. You could also throw in some stupid cheap wind at $0.002/kWh to get to a 100% renewable + local offset pretty cheap.",

Are you paying more than $2000 a year for electricity?  \n\\- You will still require electricity when it's nighttime. You will be paying for that unless you get a battery system (which will explode the cost).  \n\\- You will still need to pay a fee to connect.  \n\\- Likely the utility will not allow you to build to 100% of your electric usage. And your usage is likely to go up in the future (more electronics, EVs, etc).  \n\n\nSolar is great. I'm thrilled to be in the industry. Rooftop solar isn't for everyone. And at these interest rates the only way I would consider solar is paying cash and feeling I'm getting a better ROI than if I just invested it.",

I guess we could call them that is that they want to focus more on things like wind and solar power which are undeniably cleaner than oil and coal. I don't mind that.\n\nLook at the air in Beijing and tell me you would improve millions and millions of peoples quality of lives by cleaning up the energy sources they use.\n\nSo while these things may or may not be causing climate change which could turn the world into an extremely hostile place for human beings, you can at least know that you're easing the burden on health care systems by supporting green energy and creating a more sustainable planet. Gas and oil will certainly run out sometime (even if a long ways away) but it's going to be a helluva time until solar power and wind power runs away.\n\nAnd solar is easily obtained in space, which is where our species needs to go if we'd like to live say past the time frame for which the sun shall exist without imploding or doing whatever stars do at the end of their life cycles.\n\nSolar panel can be got with out destroying the gulf of mexico or fucking over people in South America. \n\nThat's kind of why I'm green. It makes everything more local, more sustainable, and cleaner.",

You can look at the California Solar Initiative data to get a sense of pricing in your area.  Unfortunately, installers stopped reporting about a year ago, but you might be able to find an 8 panel system in your area to price-compare with.\n\nSolarworld panels were good enough for me.  I have 24 270 Mono Black panels.  That said, if you're space limited that much, I'd look at Sunpower for the additional efficiency.  I'd especially do it if you are considering an EV.\n\nMicroinverters are nice, and with only 8 of them, you have fewer to fail.  That said, if you don't have any shading issues, you might consider a string inverter, which could drop the price a bit.",

But his attitude keeps getting him booted from jobsites whenever he gets into a supervisory role. I really don't know where he'll end up. He's getting to old for the roof.\n\nAnyone in the industry, young or old, should learn how to design and array from top to bottom, and also learn the supply chain. As u/TED_666 noted, the ability to deliver quality, complete designs (including a complete Bill of Material list) is a great way to get off the roof.\n\nThere are more people getting into the industry than are currently in the industry, and that will hold true for the next 15 years. There are plenty of non-labor jobs assisting enabling mainstream electricians/architects/engineers to build solar. Sadly, harder hand skills don't necessarily translate into softer office skills.",

        "comment": "And look at those numbers that /u/SnickeringBear listed there and realize you're getting scammed, hustled, robbed, screwed whatever you want to call it on those install costs. \n\nThere are, in fact, plug in grid-tie inverters which run $100 per 250watt panel that you can simply plug into a 220 outlet without an electrician. The arguments you will hear for why you can't use them are flat out lies about how you need islanding protection (they have it) you need phase angle correction (they have it) you need MPPT to get efficient use of the panels (they have it) etc. \n\nThe only thing they don't have is a huge install cost and that's great for installers, electricians and utilities that don't want solar or rooftops. \n\nI challenge anyone who wants to claim that there is some hazard in the use of these devices to show me a single instance where a fire or even a tripped breaker has been caused by one of these devices which have been sold internationally for years now. Install costs are an outrageous scam perpetrated by solar installers which perfectly fits the agenda of the utilities. \n\nOP is quite correct that the panels are far cheaper than the general public believes and it's shocking to see how cheap they actually are when you're told that it's going to be $12,000 to install a small system. \n\nMy brother in Washington State just had an offer for US$12,000 for a 2kW system. That's absurd. And yet when I began helping him look around for alternatives we found that market is largely controlled by a single installation company that has used regulatory capture to push out any independent electricians. We contacted multiple independent electricians looking for cheaper prices and they all said --No way! They all insisted that there was only one choice which was the same company with the stellar install costs.",

Tesla has pretty much shown proof-of-concept for that (i.e. sufficient range in a standard form factor).  The only remaining task is cost reduction and fast charging infrastructure between cities.  The 2/3 cut in battery costs will take care of the former.  The latter... undecided.\n\n\n&gt;  I think that gasoline and electricity prices will move pretty much in tandem over very long periods of time, because energy tends to be priced by the BTU\n\nThat depends.  Right now, fossil fuel costs and electricity costs are loosely coupled because we use fossil fuels to generate electricity.  However, that is not a rule.  \n\nEven if they remain coupled, cost per mile for a EV \"fuel\" is about 20-25% the cost of gas, so EVs will still be less expensive on a per-mile basis.\n\nBut - electricity costs need not be coupled and that's an advantage to EVs.  Utilities can install wind or other non-fossil sources to reduce costs.  If they don't, you could install solar panels on your roof and generate your own.",

        "comment": "Whether or not you realize it, you're asking for a heavy subsidy. \n\nTo even swap kilowatts 1-to-1 is a subsidy, because it gives the panels free use of the distribution network, and doesn't include any reserves for maintenance or capital expansion -- not to mention profit, in the case of privately owned utilities.\n\nHere in Washington State, the utilities are required to go much further, paying 62 cents/kWh for electricity if the panels and inverters are made in the state. Their wholesale cost for that electricity is 3-5 cents/kWh, and the retail rate averages 8.5 cents an hour, which makes for a *very* heavy subsidy indeed.\n\nTOU rates are available in some places. In that case, they wind up being a kind of sleight-of-hand. The ratepayer \"subsidizes\" himself, cutting use during the day and using more at night. What you ask -- for the utility to pay retail high TOU rates for mid-day panel generation while collecting low TOU rates for night-time panel generation -- would be a gigantic subsidy. How gigantic would, of course, depend on the details.\n\nI'm a believer in both solar and EVs, and support *some* subsidies. I think 1:1 swaps are reasonable, i.e., a kilowatt for a kilowatt, but I wouldn't support going past that and forcing utilities to pay peak retail rates for power generated by panels. The farthest I'd go is forcing them to pay the higher of a kilowatt-for-kilowatt and the peak wholesale rate.\n\nPast that, you wind up subsidizing solar panels in places where they're simply not the best alternative. Germany has done this, and as a result their electricity rates are just astronomical. And the hilariously misleading statistical cherry picking that gets done aside, the results of solar power there have been miniscule at best. The claims for big results *always* fall apart on honest and rigorous examination.\n\nSolar power makes a whole lot of sense in sunny, southern latitudes. Make me emperor, and every rooftop in Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, San Diego, and the L.A. basin would have panels, and so would some pretty big stretches of the Mojave Desert. It makes all kinds of sense there. Same in parts of Texas and Florida. But heavy subsidies in places like Massachusetts and Washington State (even in the sunny areas east of the Cascades) simply do not cost out.\n\nAre we going to do this just to make ourselves feel good? Well, that's the local specialty in Seattle, where everyone falls all over themselves to *appear* virtuous. Or are we going to do this for real, and deploy limited resources in the smartest way? Are people serious, or just playing some sort of virtue-status game? At the horrible (ha ha!) risk of offending some of the innumerate dreamers here, I'm a realist. Show me the real numbers, not some faked-up fantasies, and then we talk.",

I think AP is great on the interstate (I am not buying FSD on my Model Y order, 4k maybe, 12k no) but haven't tried out other manufactures. I did have a good laugh watching the Ford system take a slight curve and the engineer calling it hard or something like that. Anyhow I see other posts are talking about it already so no need to go into more detail.\n\nI wouldn't count the $7,500 rebate as a \"discount\", just something the manufactures can mark up for more profit (plus you have to pay state taxes and possibly get a bigger loan for it). I support boosting manufactures profits so they invest more but soon as the rebate runs out the 2 manufactures did drop price some (or dealers marked up less). If it makes you feel like you are getting a deal then that is all that counts in the end though.\n\nAssuming you reconsider IMO Tesla SR with LFP battery seems like a great fit. Battery should last over 1mil miles and is quite efficient (not that electricity costs much) and you can charge it to 100% so for a daily drive it won't be much different than a LR. The main downside of LFP is super cold (just remember to preheat) but you don't have that issue. Maybe not the greatest road trip car but from what I hear about equal to the Mach-E and can use Superchargers and with an adapter CCS (hard to get in the US right now, hopefully change 'soon') and chademo (discontinued but available). Hopefully the supercharger network opens up to Mach-E (and others) so may become a moot point 'soon'.\n\nWhatever you choose I thank you for narrowing it to a BEV. Hopefully you will end up saving a noticeable amount of money with that commute and I can breathe a little better. At $0.10/kWh it will he hard to justify solar panels but it may be the next thing you may find yourself wanting oh and an electric mower. Good luck.",

The Chinese have seen this and they don't want the Americans involved in the \"New Energy\". With solar panels, the price of energy is less than 1cents/KWh.",

        "comment": "LOLOL.\n\nSo let's point out a few things. California is moving to 100% renewable, with 100% electric transportation. Currently they're only 37% renewable with solar leading the way at 17%.\n\nCalifornia averages 5.82 PSH, so for the other 18 hours of the day those panels put out 0w. And they want to build more. And now they want you to charge your car at night, when there is little generation.\n\nThere are 31 million registered cars in California with 27 million drivers. The average Cali driver drives 15k miles a year. That works out to 41 miles per day. The average EV in California is getting ~3mi/kwh. That number will go down as larger and larger EV's come out and everyone in LA ends up with a Range River and G Wagon EV. \n\nAt 3kwh/mi, that means 16kwh per night (factoring in charge efficiency loss), per driver. That comes out to **432,000 MWH PER NIGHT**, just to charge the cars. That is not inclusive of any other residential loads (you guys love your A/C!) or inclusive of commercial trucking which will also be moving to EV. \n\nAnd you're here posting links to \"installing many 100mwh batteries across the state\". You would need solar arrays the size of Nevada to collect that much energy during the day, to charge that many batteries, which then will get depleted at night. Wind and hydro certainly isn't going to do it all. You would need THOUSANDS of those 100mwh plants to store the energy that you use at night, just for charging cars.\n\nLike everything else in California, it all sounds good in the happy little fantasy world that the lawmakers live in.",

You could purchase from someone like www.unboundsolar.com and have it shipped from them to Poland and then arrange a truck  from there.  To connect and fill from the grid you need something like a Tesla Powerwall that has a grid-tied gateway.  Unbound Solar can answer all or most technical questions about install-setup.  Transportation from Poland into Ukraine must be arranged, and there is a lot of transportation happening, but it needs arranged.",

And they refuse to acknowledge that my roof is demolished, in spite of 42 lag screws that missed EVERY rafter, holding onto nothing but tin and 1/2” OSB, which has caused more than a dozen places that leak, directly below the panels. The neighboring house is on a hill overlooking my garage, and in their yard is a massive juniper tree, which shades more than half the panels for 5 months, and the system uses a series inverter, which model was actually discontinued several years prior to the installation, in 2018. But the neighbor refuses to allow me to top THEIR tree, and in the Sunrun PPA it very clearly states that tree trimming is part of the customer’s responsibility… so I can’t even make the garbage work more efficiently, because I can’t cut the tree, but it would not have been an issue if they had put the panels in the correct location, as shown on the contract. All in all, it’s more of a problem with Sunrun, than with PPAs in general, but the biggest scam is that the PPA provider pockets the government incentives, while overcharging 4x what the value of the system actually is by the time the contract is filled, at which point the equipment will start to degrade.",

I'm guessing you can't get near them to see if they have any labels etc. on them.\n\nWhat inverter do you have, is there a rating on that? If it doesn't say then put some pictures on here from various angles and see if we can track it down. The inverter capacity will set an upper limit on the array size and it would be rare to fit one that was way too big so say 80-90% of that will give a fair guess at the actual capacity anyway.\n\nFor the array size and definitely for the FIT you really need to be in touch with the former owner, if that's at all possible?\n\nWith FIT payments, I'm afraid it's not going to be good news - FIT didn't start until 2010, so a 2000 system won't have been installed under that scheme and I don't think it can have been registered for it later either. Even if it had, you would need to do some paperwork with the previous owner to get the payments to transfer to you, they don't go with the property automatically.\n\nWashing: if they are at a moderate angle (ours is only 18 degrees) then I believe rain does the job well anyway - so unless it's trivial for you to get to them, I wouldn't worry.\n\nThe inverter needs replacing when it breaks! Are there any LEDs, meters, control gear associated with the system that you can read off? I'd be surprised if there was any sort of remote monitoring like you get with a lot of modern systems but a self installed system back then would have been by an enthusiast who would have wanted to know what was going on with it.\n\nMore questions welcome! Even if it doesn't get FIT and is down on the original generating power (because cells get less efficient as they age) my view is that solar PV is still well worth having.",

        "comment": "I got a quote from Longhorn for a 4.486kw system for $1.82/w or $11,575 after Federal tax credit.  There are no other incentives in Leander.  This was in Williamson County using Perdenales Electrical Co-op, with a composite shingle, two-story house built in 2004.  Not sure if your house has an odd roof or needs updated electrical, but there are other things that might factor into the price.  The value of energy generation was forecast to be $71.04/year.  It would have taken me 13.6 years to pay it off, or about a 7.4% ROI.  That's not bad, and it doesn't factor in any increases in electrical rates.  If I invest this money and get a decent 6%, I would still have to pay capital gains taxes on that.\n\nAustin Energy has an [incentive program](http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/solar-solutions/solar-pv-systems/current-solar-incentive-levels/!ut/p/a1/jVFNb4MwDP0tPXCkMXRsaDdKqxb6wWEbY1ymrEtppJAgJzB1v35hTJ1UrVpzsGL7-fnJj5SkIKWkHa-o4UpS0efl7au3DG68KXhp-Bh4EMXpdh7kkzSZgQW8WAD4ob-MwU-yeTaDJM_yKFvFsIgnV85feBH8N59escDHTbypSNlQc3C53CtSaCUouk3n6qM2rNak2LWITBp36HC5swnvmCtYx4TuaSL5NgktDbI9Q4bjFu19DsY09w44QFttuGSSYXUc71TtwEejHWgUGipsm9k_qgppbavDEhvb_s6nwq8eB5Bp_t5roOJH08DtIjXsLzkHpQ0pzmWQZ1J-n-hk0eLODyFaxNNVkG-9aO6fA_7wcABcNqmpn4rP9VJ06_1DUo1GXwxFwcE!/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/), but you said your cost was after discount, so I'm not sure if this was factored in or not.  \n\n[Austin Energy](http://austinenergy.com/wps/portal/ae/programs/solar-solutions/solar-pv-systems/residential-solar-energy-rate/!ut/p/a1/jVHLboMwEPyWHDgSL1Ba1JtDEI88OLSllEvltuYhgY1sQ5V-fU2Qoipt1PhgeXdndqwZVKAcFYyMTUVUwxlpp7q4fbUi98ZagZV4j64F2E_2gZs5SbwGDXjRALA9O_LBjtMgXUOcpRlONz6EvnMl_8LB8B8_uULAFjt_V6GiJ6o2G1ZylEveEmH2oykPUtFOolxQ2XxQphrSmvOUMiqqgymIotMWzN4cT28RtKSCiuUgtD21Uv29AQaQQaqGzZTlO-8M-OylAT0XirR6TPVb8EqQTnfn_foeJptPjZ_f-a1Xc6lQfq6DnlFxtOAUQXhne4BDf7Vxs72FA_sc8EdGM-ByCH33lH9to3bclg9xtVh8A1iBxGI!/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/) has an odd way of factoring your solar power credit.  Instead of measuring the sheer amount of electricity produced, they measure the value of that electricity, then knock it off your bill, up to the amount they would have charged you.  Any excess will roll over to the next month, but cannot be applies to other areas of your bill, such as water or trash.  Not sure if this can be applied to the \"customer charge\" portion, which is merely the privilege of being hooked up to the grid.\n\nIt seems pretty high if you are getting your quote after federal and AE incentives, about average if you are getting a quote prior to incentives being applied.  I hope this helps.\n\nThese were using 24 Green Triplex PM245P00 (240-260w) panels with a Solis-5K-2G-US inverter connected to a desktop CPU monitoring system.",

Spaying your pet before her first heat offers the best protection from these diseases. Neutering your male companion prevents testicular cancer and some prostate problems.\n\nIf you don't plan to breed your animal, (again remember pets aren't technically vegan, but if your going to have a shelter pet, it is best to spay or neuter,) there is no point in not spaying or neutering as it is only helpful.  Animals don't take contraceptives like humans...\n\n&gt;you should not attack it  \n\nof course I should attack it, it is pointlessly breeding and killing billions of animals.  this isn't just about cows but other mammals, birds and fish.\n\n&gt;are you going to attack installations of solar power because the companies are only doing it to save money?\n\nwtf are you talking about?  Has nothing to do with this stop trying to derail arguments.   I don't attack vegans for going vegan to save money, no.\n\n&gt;i hope some of you see how this vegan here is DOING HARM? \n\nya by not eating any animals in almost 3 years I'm clearly the one doing harm.  my shelter cat was neutered, omgz, he doesn't piss on my furniture and won't develop cancer!\n\ngo youtube Earthings man or woman, good lord.",

So, yes, I would be saving ABOUT $65/month (assuming I can get the range they claim...which is a whole issue I forgot to add in my already long post haha), even more if gas prices go up (assuming electricity doesn't go up), but I also have to consider the increase in insurance and a bit in registration, and the fact that I can still get a hybrid that gives me better mileage, which would definitely yield no savings over an EV. \n\nBUT, and I need to repeat this, I think EVs are the future and I want one. I just wanted to point out the hurdles carmakers are creating to make this not happen anytime soon.\n\nOh, and yes, I dream of not having to stop at a gas station, and having solar panels to charge my vehicle.

The batteries can provide that easily, and the panels will charge them.",

Unfortunately, a lot of people just live in areas where all of the solar installers are scams. Here in Oregon, the state solar incentives only go to the installers, which the consumers rarely ever see reflected in their price.",

I heard that a Tesla Roadster charging overnight (when electricity is cheaper) would consume less power (by $) than a solar panel would produce all day (again $) when the electricity is sold back to the grid. Effectively that is a free charge of your car. Find out if this adds up when people are leasing. Now they have free @home charging!\n\nI also like the idea of EV taxis and little monitors on the back of headrests to inform people of what they are experiencing. I secretly dream of seeing a fleet of Tesla Model S / Fiskers doing this.\n\nOther ideas... What about doing a spin-off of [Carpool](http://www.llewtube.com/) by Robert Llewelyn. Find out about his copyrights on this as a TV show has been created on the back of his personal online creation...\n\nFinally, I think you need to know your product and industry **inside out**. People will ask about insurance, planned infrastructure developments, mechanics in the area for when something goes wrong, electric shocks, water in the system.. EMPs - the lot!\n\nIf you, as the expert, can't answer any and all questions then you won't convince the buyer that it worth their money.\n\nLet us know how it turns out and announce any public events etc you put on to us Redditors. Unfortunately I'm not based in the US but I will admire from afar. Good luck :D",

Everything works fine as long as clouds don't interfere, but for how long does the stored energy allow operation, or in other words for how many cloudy days can this particular type of solar power produce power before running out of stored energy? If the answer is anywhere close to 0, then this type of solar power is unfortunately just as incapable of baseload electricity production as other forms of solar power.",

        "comment": "I would argue that this is false.\n\nCheap American panels generally lose against cheap Asian panels. Usually for use in solar farms and large commercial arrays.\n\nQuality panels, typically residential use, it's the same and sometimes cheaper to buy American. For example, my business can get Solaria 330W panels for slightly less than LG 320W panels. Both all black panels. The quality is the same, but I'd give the asthetic edge to Solaria. SunPower is similar, focused on quality and top of the line. \n\nBut it's kind of the truth that most American companies don't really focus their efforts on making cheap panels. The American brands like being the quality brands. \n\nI think SolarWorld is one of the few American made panels that tried to do mass production cheap panels. But their quality was poor, and the attempt to try and hand make lots of components made them expensive and inconsistent.\n\nPanasonic's NY factory will change this. They will produce large scale panels for commercial and utility use. Their process will be automated. They will be very competitive I'm sure. Sadly most of these panels will go to SolarCity/Tesla I'm sure.\n\nEdit: Regarding production creating pollution. Silicon fabrication actually doesn't produce much byproduct or pollution. The plants themselves can be powered by clean energy. Almost all chemicals are reused, recycled, or neutralized in the process. Silicon fabrication is a pretty clean process with only marginal effort. And it is shown that even panels produced in bad manufacturing environments are net energy positive shortly after being deployed.",

        "comment": "&gt; it feels a lot more comfortable buying a car from a company that's been making and iterating on a model for a while, rather than from a company that's still in the proverbial diapers.\n\nI agree with that.  I won't be an unpaid tester, that's why I chose the Model 3, which has been through the initial learning curve.  It's still good that an established manufacturer recognizes that they've gone down the wrong path and are pulling back.  It's because they have to - they've seen the competition, and they don't measure up.\n\nStill, it does mean you have to be careful in picking a company you trust.  After this transition period (another 5 years at least) you'll have your pick of reliable, tested platforms.\n\nNote: electricians are currently having their way with my electric hookup to install a 100 amp panel just for my Tesla wall charger.  We'll have the Tesla solar panels in place by Spring to generate enough power for 3 electric vehicles.",

        "comment": "1. Nuclear might be the 'safest' by measure of death print, but that is hardly a measure of safety. I would say radioactive exposure, whilst not necessarily lethal, is harmful and not safe in other ways. Furthermore, after Fukushima, scientists took a long hard look at how they estimated safety in their calculations and found out they grossly underestimated the risks. And forgive me for saying so, but it seems naive to believe everything the nuclear agencies are piling out. Perhaps its time to start referencing peer reviewed papers with high impact factors?\n2. According to you, this may not be a concern, but I assure, for many people it is.\n3. Undisposable low level radioactive waste is my concern. I realise you keep comparing this somehow to renewables materials waste, but it's not really comparable. One is a monumental problem that has not seen any kind of solution in a century almost and keeps growing, the other a local problem in China due to lax environmental regulations. I mean, if after a century of the brightest minds working on it comes up with the solution of 'burying it', you know another hundred or even a thousand years will not help.\n4. Modern nuclear plants that are being built are financial disasters. They will not only be not cheap, but the government has had to finance most of it through taxpayer's money, becoming liable. Years behind schedule, billions overdue, and at the end, taxpayers pay the bill for overly priced baseload which is not even compatible with modern electricity grids. Win win? More like not. See Hinkley C in the UK, the very very late French nuclear reactors, and the new \"Putin has your back\" Olkiluoto nuclear reactor to be built in Finland.\n6. If that were true, Germany's, Denmarks, and a bunch of other countries electricity grids would currently be nonfunctional. Of course since they are, and happen to be one of the most reliable ones in the world, we know this to be the intonation of the age-old 'baseload fallacy'.\n7. This is a bit more personal, and a new point. You come across as someone really passionate about this. What I don't understand is why? Most people don't want even a modern nuclear reactor close to their hometowns. History has proven it to be a risky business, and if there were any other possibility, then rather go with that option. Luckily, we are in the midst of a green energy revolution. Solar PV and wind are getting cheaper by the minute almost, and more efficient. Storage only comes into play with almost 80% penetration of renewables on most grids. We are still very far away from those kinds of figures, and unlike nuclear waste, we already have solutions and are working feverishly for better ones. Nuclear? Recent examples in Europe have been disastrous. No private company wanted to touch these plans with a barge foot pole. The government and taxpayers money is the ONLY reason they went ahead with it. AND they will be grossly subsidised in the future. Why not rather invest in something much cleaner and cheaper, that is the way of the future on the electricity grid?",

Is it to intentionally scare the public into submission?\n\nWould it scare the public if they were told that the Earth’s temperature is almost the same as it was a thousand years ago?

Why are world leaders promoting the highly flammable pollutant lithium that takes massive amounts of water to produce?\n\nWhy do the U.S. and other world leaders sign up for an expensive push to stop deforestation when it is not happening? The U.S has planted more trees than we have harvested for decades, so why the lies?\n\n…..\n\nAre you troubled by all the wildlife that wind turbines and solar panels kill, especially considering how much you want to expand these killers?\n\nIsn’t it despicable that Obama gave 30-year permits to kill bald and golden eagles?\n\nWhat do you think of politicians who intentionally undercount deaths of wildlife while they push an agenda?\n\nWhy do CEOs and billionaires go along with this agenda? Because they don’t want to be canceled and hassled?\n\nWhy do scientists go along? Because they know that is what will make them the most money?\n\nWhy do educators go along? So they don’t get fired and canceled and so they aren’t called anti-science and deniers?\n\nWhy do politicians repeat this stuff even though the scientific data show that the climate has always changed cyclically and naturally? Because they want power and money. They also don’t want to be called names.\n\nWhy do most journalists go along without doing research and asking questions? Because most haven’t cared about facts for a long time — only pushing the radical leftists’ agenda.\n\nIndoctrination is a truly dangerous thing.

Also, the Tesla solar roof I believe has been put on hold indefinitely due to supply constraints.  This is in addition to Tesla taking forever to get projects done (just like the cars, they have a ton of demand they can't stay up with).\n\nHopefully you have a really big south face roof, cause you'll need a lot of panels to cover your usage.  I would talk with local installers and see what kind of quotes they give you.  Since you're in Norcal, you'll want to look for around $3/watt in pricing.\n\nYou're also going to need your yearly energy usage.  I know you said you just moved into your home, so you may have to estimate what you think your yearly usage will be in kWh so the installers can size a system properly for you.",

I did spin through the net to try and verify the claim and clearly did not factor the last sentence in the report.\n\nWhat I did find while searching the internet (and looking at the available product) is the difference in the current cell efficiency used in production panels v bleeding edge research. They are still sitting at the low to mid teens. The best I could find was a panel using a cell with an efficiency 19.3% (SunPower). There also appears to be a lag between what is available from the manufacturer and what is being installed. I guess there is some way to go before we see cells with 20%+ efficiency on a roof. A 12 panel solution at 15% efficiency translates into a 9 panel solution at 20%",

        "comment": "Let them subsidise. The huge investments that they are having to make for technology that will undoubtably change in the coming years are savings or the rest of the world. See this article regarding DRAM prices as an illustration.\n\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/chipmakers-lose-billions-as-ipad-challenges-computers-tech.html\n\nA snippet from the article:\n\n\"Elpida Memory Inc. [japan] (6665), Hynix Semiconductor Inc. and other makers of dynamic random-access memory, the most common chip in computers, lost a combined $14 billion in the past three years, according to Bloomberg calculations. That comes after the $37 billion that researcher DRAMeXchange estimates they spent building factories in a bet on continued growth in the industry\"\n\nThe biggest challenge to any company in a changing technology landscape (as with PV) is one of investment v the speed of change. Back in the day when companies like IBM were the only kid on the block, their R&amp;D departments could be years ahead of what was being sold because there was no need to bring that new thing to market. There was no competition. That was not good for the customer though. \n\nWith PV - every couple of months there is a new improvement in performance being discovered/invented. If someone comes up with an improvement of 5% over a \"current\" technology that is at 20% efficiency then that 25% uplift in performance (moving from 20% efficiency to 25%) is major. If the new panels cost the same, then who is going to purchase the old stuff? If the new technology is fundamentally different, then the old plant is basically scrap.\n\nEvery subsidised PV panel out of China is a gift from the Chines people to provide cheep energy to the rest of the world.\n\nSomeone will invent a roll to roll dye sensitised process to compete with silicon and then you can start churning the stuff out like wall paper. Then kindly thank the Chinese for investing all that money and subsidising the product that no one wants any longer.\n\nWith all automation, the jobs will not be in the manufacturing but design, sales and installation.\n\nIf the country gets cheep(er) electricity then:\n   Cost of making other goods goes down\n   Cost to households goes down\n   PV installers are busy\n   More available money in the market\n   Money spent on other things\n   Jobs created elsewhere\n\nOh look - someone did it....\n\nhttp://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID=32898\n \nChina anyway will blow itself up. The one child policy is resulting in an ageing population with fewer young people. Wage inflation is having a major impact. Already the total cost in some areas of manufacturing (because it's no longer acceptable to allow these poor people to work 7 days a week and commit suicide, child labor etc), wage inflation, shipping costs, exchange costs etc is leading some manufactures to close their plant in China and bring the work back. A BBC documentary http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01hzgkv\" The town taking on China\" shows the process.\n\nIt does not follow that because your not making it you lose innovation. Look at ARM. They don't make a single chip (and their CEO is clear about the madness in investing billions in new plant that will be outdated before it comes on stream) but their design is in almost every smart phone and they continue to innovate.\n\nEnjoy the subsidised PV panels!",

Not when some are programmable, others intermittent. \n\nNo you can't assume these prices are going to stay the same when you change your entire grid. \n\nIf you were to build a grid with solar panels only, at night your electricity price will reach infinity, no matter how cheap solars panels cost right now. \n\nSo if you're interested in figuring out an energy system that doesn't worsen too much climate change and maybe doesn't hurt biodiversity too badly, maybe consider the cost in co2, cement, metals, land use or human lives...",

The truth is I do want to go SunPower because it's an American company and employees veterans and veteran owned but only if the price increase is reasonable. Both installers have a 5-star Yelp rating with tons of reviews.  the LG Rep is a friendly acquaintance as well.\n\nI hate that I keep asking you questions because your replies are so awesome but I added this question to my last post in an edit that you maybe didn't see:\n\nalso, the sunpower guy says that the 280w micro inverters on the LGs limit the panels to 280 w which changes the numbers to 15 panels * 280 for 17250 = $4.11/watt. is this true or is he bullshitting me?",

They also simply state give wrong information as well on many things (eg: batteries, no, this battery isn't LFP) simply because the consumers they normally deal with are more clueless.\n\nI've talked to owners as well who 'think' they know everything and have also given wrong SGIP information and they simply don't know.\n\nBottom line as OP says is as a consumer, all these companies are the same.  The \"smart consumer\" does their research and the lesser companies will get weeded out.  You give too much credit to solar installers to assume solar is that complex for someone to spend a bit of time to understand the basics and your sales method sounds like if a consumer asks more questions, you're not bothering because you assume you're always right and you know everything.\n\nI didn't pick the cheapest option btw.",

        "comment": "You're somewhat tripping over yourself here, with all the converting backwards and forwards of units that aren't really comparable to one another. For example, while gasoline has that energy content, most of it is never used in propelling a car. That, for example, is why you're getting that disparity between filling up a Porsche in 3 minutes but a Model 3 in 30 seconds at equivalent \"energy\" transfer rates. If you go and account for the conversion efficiency, then gasoline has maybe 10 MJ that's actually usable instead of its 34 MJ theoretical value; and if you do the same math with that number, you'll discover that you'll end up with both vehicles filling up at pretty much the same speed.\n\nThis is not a coincidence, since at this point you're using the downstream output of a heat engine in both cases, and the utilization of this downstream energy is pretty much equivalent. An electric motor has a 90%-95% conversion efficiency of electric into kinetic energy; but a crankshaft also has a 90%-95% conversion efficiency of reciprocal motion into rotary motion. The only difference is that the ICE car carries the heat engine that does the prior-step fuel conversion with it, while for the electric car, that heat engine is located elsewhere (a power plant).\n\nSo, while your numbers might look interesting, you cannot really use them in the way you did. That converting battery storage capacity into liters of gasoline, for instance. The numbers look so incredibly lopsided not because EVs are so good, but because you're comparing apples to oranges.\n\nNote: I'm not arguing that EVs aren't better. They just aren't *this much* better.",

Certain forms of renewable energy (hydro, sustainable biomass, geothermal) can provide baseload energy generation on a large scale, although this is of course dependent on the local potential. Intermittent renewables are a bit more tricky, but with correct planning and infrastructure they too can be a significant affordable source of electricity. Solar is an especially attractive form of renewable energy, due to the fact that most developing countries are close to the equator.\n\nNow, the question is, can developing countries afford to build such infrastructure combined with renewable energy? In many cases renewable energy is by itself already affordable when compared to fossil fuels and will keep getting cheaper, so the question depends mostly on the price of the infrastructure. Its price is most likely higher if it is built to be able to handle (intermittent) renewables, reguiring larger grids and/or storage, but it is likely that building infrastructure that is optimized for fossil fuels would become more or less obsolete quite fast, assuming that renewable keep up with their fast pace of development. Furthermore, renewable energy would provide them energy security, and developing countries may have political pressure to cut emissions in the near future, especially if climate change keeps happening at the predicted pace. \n\nOne possibility would be that developed countries would make up at least a part of the difference between the price of renewable energy and fossil fuels, thus making renewables more attractive to developing countries.\n\nThe choice is theirs, however. They don't need to care what the developed world says. As I said in another post, if they want to build fossil fuel plants, then they can just go and do it.",

The first two commercial solar/battery cars are supposed to be the lightyear one (expensive as hell) and the Sonos (more reasonably priced but dunno when it'll come out).\n\nIn places with lots of sunshine like AZ or CO you could actually get a reasonable amount of generation if you equipped cars with movable solar panels when the car was stopped for long enough, but I suspect it'll probably be 5+ years before cars start coming to market in a small way (after the cyber truck has some success with it), and a decade before it happens in a big way.",

        "comment": "Well it just seems strange to have way more inverter capacity than generating capacity. So in this case you have a battery that has 900Wh of capacity, so your little 50W panel will take 18h of full sun to charge it (figure you can get 3 or 4 equivalent hours of sunshine a day, so we are talking most of a week) if you don't have any other load connected. Then if you connect your 1kW inverter and use it at full capacity, you'll discharge the thing in less than an hour. In some specific cases this may be desirable, but in general you need at least as much generating capacity as you have loads, or even more, depending on the load profile. But maybe in your case it makes sense just to have the ability to run the odd 110V appliance off your battery every once and a while, while mostly running DC loads like your light and radio\n\nBut I think your biggest problem right now is that you are pairing a panel with 18V Vmp with a 6V battery and a 12V inverter. At the least you need to switch to a 12V battery to use that inverter, but even then you will be wasting alot of solar power by forcing the panel to work at 12V (ie you'll only get around 30W out of it), so you would be better off finding a panel intended for use at 12V, like [this one](http://www.amazon.ca/Renogy-100W-Polycrystalline-Starter-Kit/dp/B00DCEKKQ0/ref=pd_sim_sbs_lg_4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0RRTQW8HMHFN16V9MF1W)\n\nEdit: you may want to look at [this exchange](http://www.reddit.com/r/solar/comments/2ylqit/using_charge_controller_load_switching_to_isolate/) from a few days back. /u/MrCloggy was offering some helpful advice to someone looking to set up a system similar to what you want. Actually, now that we've summoned him, perhaps he'll chime in over here.",

I show that there is well established scientific background to the effect.  (I feel it's worth mentioning that it's a topic I see well represented in all the high school and university chemistry textbooks I've used.)\n\n&gt; No reference to solar power or wind farms.\n\nWhat exactly do you expect a \"climate-energy bill\" to include?  Of course, this is a diversion from my questions of how the EU already has a growing renewables portfolio, even in such hard economic times.  Such refutes his claims that the initiatives are expensive since green energy technology is already taking hold in the market without internalizing social costs of polluting energy sources.  He (and you) also fail to recognize the fact that energy conservation (which tends to be a huge part of current green initiatives nowadays) will actually incur less cost onto consumers.  (While it's not the same legislation or legislative environment, it's worth mentioning that separate CBO and MIT studies of the American Waxman-Markey Climate Bill approved by the House last year were shown to cost the average family less than $1 a day, and would actually save money for the poorest homeowners.  Similar results would be expected of a similarly constructed European bill.)\n\n&gt; the focus of the discussion is illegitimately diverted from the proper subject matter\n\nI think it's rather legitimate, personally.  The author is commenting on a scientific theory, but he (and thank you for correcting me -- he is not a physicist, but instead a politician with a degree in history) has no scientific training.  If he is wrong on this point, then his overall message is damaged.  This is not a personal attack, but a relevant questioning of the author's credentials.",

With enough money you can do anything but an off grid system isn't designed to save money.  Unless you have cabin in the Uintas that it will cost 100k to run power to.",

        "comment": "I believe that using a mass driver like that described in this paper \n\nElectromagnetic Launchers for Space Applications Schroeder, Gully, Driga\nIEEE Transactions on Magnetics Vol 25, no 1, January 1989, pp 504-507\n\nwww.utexas.edu/research/cem/IEEE/PR%2083%20Gully%20Publications.pdf\n\nIs not only a cheaper and more sustainable solution to a short-term global transition, it also allows us to scale up literally millions of times beyond our current energy usage limits with the original source of all energy on this planet --the sun.   \n\nYou think 175,000 TWh is significant to the power of the sun? \n\nLet me point something out because I think there's a common misunderstanding about space. People like to complain that space is already crowded with human crafted debris. That's utter insanity and a failure of grasp simple geometrical concepts. \n\nIf we go to GEO orbit and draw a sphere around the Earth. Do you have any idea how much space that sphere would encompass? I do. I'll tell you. It's a sphere 216 times the volume of the planet Earth. \n\nThat means even if you take the the entire surface area of our planet --literally every single bit of the surface including the seas and the arctic poles-- and stretch it out flat and coat it with mirrors for the exclusive purpose of capturing the light of the sun and you place it into GEO, you are still not even using a fraction of a percent of the space available. \n\nAs far as the inhabitants of Earth are concerned, there are nearly infinite resources available for our use simply by drawing a straight line up from the planet and not even going a tiny fraction of the distance to the moon. It's not a fantasy. We're already there. Broadcast TV is dependent upon this ability to utilize that space. \n\nMoreover, we needn't even launch photovoltaics. Mylar film will be fine. And we don't need to lift up giant turbines either because it just happens that flywheels are incredibly efficient in space. Simple spinning rocks left in their primitive shapes can be crafted into dynamos capable of delivering thousands of times what the largest nuclear power plant dynamos can offer. If it sounds magic, well it is in some ways. Space is a magical place compared to where we live especially for large, heavy spinning machines. We spend so much time, energy and effort here on Earth trying to create conditions that are the default condition and cost not a single extra penny to make use of in massive abundance right outside our atmosphere. \n\nWe can't possibly touch the energy storage and conversion resources that space offers using our earth-bound limitations of dense atmosphere and heavy gravitational load. Instead of struggling to overcome these limitations we should just outsource the part we can't handle to where it is naturally suited. \n\nAnd where to downlink with all that power? That's easy too. Nuclear power plants are perfect. They're already wired up to electrical grids loaded with transformers and power conditioning equipment. A perfect bootstrap scenario. Again, you just go back to the original promise of nuclear power but without the flawed radioactive fission technology. \n\nAnd then the ultimate whip cream and cherry on top is that the multi-gigawatt directed energy beams coming down from space effectively create virtual space elevators. There is no need for carbon nanotube wires. You just divert some of the energy of the downlink into upward propulsion. Again, it's a bootstrap scenario. \n\nThe budget for that mass launcher is US$23 million using off the shelf components and taking two and a half years to build. I find it amazing that we have billions for single rocket launches and yet can't find resources for this kind of project, or that we have billions as rounding errors on a defense budget and yet find no use for this idea or that a the National Ignition Facility has billions of dollars in funding and yet this is not even worth building a single test system. \n\n\nEDIT:\nAnd by the way. Don't get me wrong. I have a massive solar thermal system on my house using vacuum tube water heating technology and a thermal storage system. Nonetheless, I'm well on my way to putting PV on the roof as well although I think solar thermal is amazing and far cheaper. But that's my approach. I'm all for the multiple solutions to one problem concept. I'm not saying let's abandon terrestrial solar and wind until we try a space-based solution. I'm saying let's do both quickly.",

Making everyone pay and support green companies that go bankrupt after a few years of business.  Taxing people's business out of business and regulating others out of jobs.  Don't you feel a bit ashamed to have so many out of work for something that has nothing to do with plastics in the ocean, dirty beaches, and record snowfall in the north east.\n\n\nWhy not help us help you make the earth green again.  Why not use the millions on millions to get that plastic out of the oceans instead of making useless solar panels.  Why not use the millions of wind power grants to fund beach clean ups.  If we want to leave our grand kids anything, we need to stop wasting their future money on stupid non viable projects, and start investing in real solutions now!!!",

        "comment": "I was also just throwing that out there to discuss *actual* prices and not market prices. I think a lot of companies are taking advantage of consumer ignorance. Even a lot of installers are being taken advantage of by companies like Tesla because they think that Tesla powerwall MUST be better than other options. So it is like saying that gaming PCs suck because walmart sells crappy gaming PCs, when if you order the parts yourself, you can get a good DIY PC that is the same cost, but 2x performance. (not that the build a pc market is this way currently with cyrptocurrency mining really affecting the market, but I'm sure the point comes across).   \n\n\nSo installers could lower the price, or there could be other ways that costs are reduced. I think that discussing DIY puts a lot of pressure on installers. If you went to an installer quoting you at $70k and you tell them that you could DIY for $25k, I think that you have A LOT more ability to negotiate them down 50% of their original price, or at least be aware of shopping around for a company that will. I think a lot of people are scared of solar because it is new, not because it is scary. I imagine that solar installation will be seen as something that is like being a plumber, where there is skill, but mostly there is the hard work that goes into it.",

        "comment": "You can see from the photos just how wide the front wheelbase is.  Literally as wide as a Hummer.  I imagine this thing will be curbed often; maybe a higher than average rate of the wheel and possibly entire arch assembly getting torn clean off.\n\nOther cars may clip those arches because they don't see them.  Two cars abreast in two lanes on the highway, while cars on the highway don't always stay in their lanes.  Aptera in the right lane, CUV/SUV in the left that edges over just enough to clip the Aptera's tire, and boom!  Although, if this thing loses a wheel, it looks like it'll glide smoothly across the concrete. :-D\n\nHad they added 4 tires, they could have narrowed the front wheel base to a more reasonable width.\n\nThe storage is lackluster.  As OP says, it's 25 cu ft, but it's a long storage area with little height.  You won't be using this to lug anything of a decent size, or filling it up with much to move residences.\n\nThe solar panels are pointless for anyone who has a plug at home.  The 1000 mile battery should not be offered, it's a complete waste of resources, and completely defeats the purpose of this vehicle.  The 250 mile range version for people who live in an apartment will charge fairly quickly due to its smaller battery.  Maybe the solar panels will work best in that case, and again removes the need for any more than 250 miles of range.\n\nI don't hate the idea of this car, but the price is bit hefty for something that only qualifies as a motorcycle or auto-cycle, has only 2 seats, and has minimal utility.  Had they added a fourth wheel and some additional usable storage space to allow this to be used as a primary car, then the price would be a bit more justified.\n\nI get the feeling that a lot of reservation holders are wealthy tech nerds that will get this as a second car, aka a toy, because they have too much money for their own good and love to waste resources.  If this is bought as a primary car, the 250 mile version, it's hard to beat it in terms of efficient living.  Other than simply not buying / driving a car and biking / using public transit instead.  Buying this car, and renting a larger vehicle or trading with a friend/family member when needed would be far better for the environment than buying a larger, less efficient, vehicle.",

        "comment": "Not having straight net metering means you definitely want to do your homework ahead of time.  I strongly agree with the comments suggesting a home energy monitor to collect more data.  It is important to know which hours of the day you use the most power and for which appliances.  If your utility installed a smart meter, you might be able to get hourly usage data on their website too.\n\nTake a look at PVWatts.nrel.gov and enter the information for some of the arrays you have had proposed.  One of the things it will give you is an hour-by-hour estimate of production over a full year.  You can use bits of it to see how your typical usage compares to sunny and cloudy days in each season.\n\nThe goal is to get an actual estimate of how much power you will be selling at the wholesale rate over the course of a day, extrapolated to the life of the system.  You might consume 6kW average, but if it is in 12kW spikes then 6kW solar won't cover it.  You might also end up with lots of excess in the spring and fall when the AC cycles more often.  \n\nHow is the \"excess\" power calculated to determine what you are paid?  For example, if you consume 1kWh in the first half of an hour, and produce excess 1kWh in the second half of the hour, will they cancel out?  Or will they bill you for the first and pay you half-rate for the second?\n\nHow are the Demand Charges calculated?  Is that ~$17 charge per kW incurred every year, month, day, or hour?  Depending on how the prices work out, battery storage could easily pay for itself.  Or it could pay back just enough to make it worth buying to use as backup power too.\n\nPersonally, I think if it's worth doing at all you might as well cover the whole roof.  The tax credit situation is a small argument towards installing now and making efficiency upgrades later, but only if your finances allow.  $25k cash for 12kW system is a good deal.\n\nRegardless of if you get solar, make sure you take all the low-hanging efficiency fruit.  They may die soon, but the A/C will use less power if you have the refrigerant checked and topped off every year.  How much insulation is in your house?  It's a pricey upgrade but could be worth it.  Are you on LED bulbs?  No sense wasting power to light them, and wasting more to get that heat out of your house.\n\nThis is a really interesting question that could consume me for several days of spreadsheet kung-fu given enough data.",

        "comment": "PV for hot water used to be an inappropriate use of expensive electricity when direct thermal was so much cheaper. But in some applications this might be effective.  When the cost of plumbing is much higher than electrical wiring it might be cost effective. At the Solar Power International conference a few companies had PV water heaters and the simplicity was a big advantage that is probably why they didn't use the much more efficient heat pumps to avoid the extra cost of the mechanical equipment and an inverter. \nMany utilities might prefer the PV Solar water heater because it would not reduce their energy sales as much as net metering and even shift load from on peak to off peak consumption.\nFor larger thermal systems especially combo with space conditioning along with hot water direct thermal is the way to go.  I'm now installing solar thermal collectors to heat our hydronic radiant floors. Four 10 square foot area flat plate collectors provide an enormous amount of heat. Will add evacuated tubes if more power is needed.",

        "comment": "&gt;I still think all of your 'unfair' points could be largely addressed by intelligent distribution of the carbon tax revenue.\n\nOf course you do. That's your bias. You think complex economic issues can be handled by the federal government, despite their repeated demonstrations that they are really, really bad at it. \n\n&gt;But some of those activites/lifestyles need to be disincentivized in any case. \n\nLike what? Having a job? Living in places outside of San Diego? Again, your bias is showing. You apparently feel as though your moral judgement is more important than the judgement of people trying to make a living. Let me ask you something. If we had abundant, carbon free energy, why would any of the things in my list be inherently evil? \n\nWhat you are displaying, I think, is the same sort of elitism that got us Trump. I really urge you to try to consider how what you are saying would sound to a regular working class person. I know I'm coming off as harsh, but we've conversed enough over the years that I think we can withstand each others' criticisms (like where you call me arrogant below). \n\n&gt;LOL. No thanks. This is a heavy handed solution.\n\nI find this response absolutely amazing. You are literally saying that funding R&amp;D is heavy handed while a tax that would be at least in the tens of billions of dollars is not. \n\n&gt;I'm not interested in the government (or you) picking the winners here, only the losers that produce CO2.\n\nSo you agree that the subsidies and tax credits for solar and wind were mistaken? Let me come back to the \"picking winners\" thing in a minute.\n\n&gt;If removing subsidies is what you would like, we should remove all energy subsidies.\n\nThat would kill everything that isn't fossil fuels. You call out nuclear, but the per kWh subsidy for nuclear is quite small compared to solar and wind. If we want to talk about removing subsidies, then it's only fair that we talk about removing regulation, don't you think? \n\n&gt; (Even if you are going to argue that is conventional nuclear not advanced nuclear, be aware that these are commercially unproven also.\n\nYou should tell that to Russia, who has an operating commercial breeder reactor and is building another right now. You should tell it to India that has a commercial solid fueled thorium (breeder) reactor. \n\n&gt;I also don't understand how you can justify cutting all climate research, how does that help?\n\nI specifically exempted monitoring, if you'll read my comment. But my explanation is quite simple. After decades of research, the marginal value of further research in terms of policy is very near zero. What has been the recommendation of every IPCC assessment report? Reduce fossil fuel consumption. What do you suppose AR6 will suggest? There's simply not much value left in additional research that is relevant to policy. There is, however, a tremendous opportunity cost to the funds that could better be spent on developing carbon free energy. \n\n&gt;I just don't think that a country like the US could be so heavy handed. \n\nI have no illusions that the anti-nuclear crowd will suddenly become scientifically literate. What I do hope is that thought leaders like yourself can change the messaging that the political Left sends. So long as people claim climate change should be a key priority while simultaneously opposing one of the best ways we have to combat it, we are at a political deadlock. \n\nYou asked what I would recommend, not what I think will happen. \n\n&gt;Maybe China or another country that has more control over economic development could implement such a plan.\n\nThey already are. While we dither over uninformed NIMBY-ism, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has 400 PhDs working on advanced nuclear power. \n\n&gt;I appreciate your expertise and enthusiasm for nuclear but your arrogance that you know better than everyone with expertise and enthusiasm for solar, wind ect is tough to swallow and I don't think that you have the evidence on your side to be so certain.\n\nI do appreciate the compliment, even if there's a qualifier. Let's look at the evidence. [\"Have fossil fuels been substituted by renewables? An empirical assessment for 10 European countries.\"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518300983)\n\n&gt;&gt;**Abstract**\n\n&gt;&gt;The electricity mix worldwide has become diversified mainly by exploiting endogenous and green resources. This trend has been spurred on so as to reduce both carbon dioxide emissions and external energy dependency. One would expect the larger penetration of renewable energies to provoke a substitution effect of fossil fuels by renewable sources, in the electricity generation mix. However, this effect is far from evident in the literature. This paper thus contributes to clarifying whether the effect exists and, if so, the characteristics of the effect by source. Three approaches, generation, capacity and demand, were analysed jointly to accomplish the main aim of this study. An autoregressive distributed lag model was estimated using the Driscoll and Kraay estimator with fixed effects, to analyse ten European countries in a time-span from 1990 until 2014. *The paper provides evidence for the substitution effect in solar PV and hydropower, but not in wind power sources.* Indeed, the generation approach highlights the **necessity** for flexible and controllable electricity production from **natural gas** and hydropower to back up renewable sources. **Moreover, the results prove that peaks of electricity have been an obstacle to the accommodation of intermittent renewable sources.**\n\nNow look at this line from the \"Highlights\" section:\n\n&gt;&gt;**The installed capacity of wind power preserves fossil fuel dependency.**\n\nThe thing is, power operators warned of this from the very beginning. They noted that grids can't accommodate intermittency very well and that doing so means backup with fossil fuels in less efficient configurations. Even the LA Times acknowledged this six years ago: http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/09/local/la-me-unreliable-power-20121210\n\nSo you can say that I don't know solar and wind if you like, but I've looked at the data. Solar doesn't reduce fossil fuel consumption very much and wind either doesn't reduce it at all or actually increases consumption. \n\nSo back to what should be studied and what shouldn't. Will more R&amp;D change the intermittent nature of solar and wind? No. Will it make solar and wind less diffuse? No. Let's talk energy density. What's the energy density of batteries? How does that compare to the energy density of nuclear power? (Hint: it's at least six orders of magnitude different.) How about siting? Can solar and wind be deployed as many places as nuclear? No. How about environmental concerns? Are solar panels from China being being produced responsibly? No. Are threatened species of bats and birds more likely to be killed by windmills or nuclear power plants? (Please don't do yourself the indignity of trying to conflate all birds with threatened species, as many people do when trying to defend wind.)\n\nIn short, we've spent a fortunate on forms of power that were problematic from the start, only to learn that they are problematic in the end. It's time to further develop technology that can be produce carbon-free power on demand and be deployed most places.\n\n&gt;That being said I would be very excited to see a real advancement come out of nuclear and I'm certainly in favor of more R&amp;D money in the field. \n\nExcellent. I'm glad we agree on that.\n\n&gt;However a carbon tax would also help make nuclear more economically competitive. \n\nTrue. \n\n&gt;You criticize my points as being theoretical yet carbon taxes work in the real world, do you have any evidence that they do not?\n\nI certainly do. You should have looked at more recent articles:\n\n[Canada's climate leader no more: how B.C. fell from the top](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/canada-s-climate-leader-no-more-how-b-c-fell-from-the-top-1.4149872\n)\n\n[Latest figures show B.C.'s carbon emissions continue to increase](https://vancouversun.com/business/energy/latest-figures-show-b-c-s-carbon-emissions-continue-to-increase)\n\nOf course you could look at Australia's carbon tax debacle if you wanted a fuller view of the issue. It illustrates rule #1 of policy very nicely.",

        "comment": "&gt;Oh, it's all irrelevant, yes? I thought so. It's only a MIT study, conducted by 13 experts from nuclear research and industry after all.\n\nAre you being obtuse on purpose, or is it just part of your personality?  I am pointing out that your quote mining was specific to solid fueled reactors.  Don't be mad at me for pointing out your lack of diligence, and please, please refrain from putting words in my mouth.  I already said I would look at the report more fully.  Perhaps there is something specific to liquid fuels in there that I missed.\n\n&gt;Your basic argument seems to boil down to \"Yes, but LFTRs\".\n\nIf you see it that way, it is only because you keep citing things that aren't relevant to liquid fueled reactors.\n\n&gt;So apparently, we're only talking about one specific technology for which a design hasn't even remotely been finalized and tested yet. \n\nPlease stop repeating things you know to be false.  Oak Ridge National Labs built two of these half a century ago.\n\n&gt;You will find that the study actually accommodates the possibility of molten salt reactors, for either an uranium or thorium cycle, so their conclusions stand despite your criticism.\n\nAs I said, I'll look at it.  I already pointed out that the authors specifically pointed out they didn't consider many thorium fuel cycles.\n\n&gt;If you'd cared to go back to the list of open LFTR design challenges I linked, \n\nWhat, your Wikipedia page?  The one that stated that most of the list doesn't apply to LFTRs?\n\n&gt;you will find that most of the problems above still apply for LFTRs\n\nNo.  As I've challenged you to do, look at the bottom of that section.  They noted that many of the things you call a disadvantage don't apply.  I would appreciate it if you would at least acknowledge what I have written.  Your source in this case refutes you.\n\n&gt;(except for maybe the high cost of thorium oxide production which I can't find any insightful material on). \n\nYou won't.  Thorium is incredibly cheap.\n\n&gt;In particular, the challenges do include significant proliferation risks,\n\nNo.  We've been over this.  The only weapons potential product from LFTR is U-233, and that is consumed in the process.  I will concede that if one tried really, really hard, one get get a poor weaponizable source of material.\n\n&gt;they do acknowledge higher risks to workers and health and safety,\n\nAs compared to what?  Certainly not present solid fueled light water reactor workers.  It is for damn sure less hazardous than solar power.\n\n&gt;they acknowledge challenges in the storage of liquid-salt waste, \n\nWhat waste is this?\n\n&gt;and long-term material challenges.\n\nThis again?  Please identify a single material challenge.\n\n&gt;So yes, maybe you could build a LFTR in 3 years but it will take you 20 years of testing to see whether your design is commercially feasible in the long run.\n\nBullshit.  You are just making this up.  \n\nI would hope you could admit by this point that you have been beaten pretty soundly on this topic.  Your assertions were nothing more than regurgitated talking points.  Your sources showed problems with solid-fueled reactors, but very few with liquid fueled reactors.  Your sources openly admitted such.  Now please go rethink your position on this.  As I've said, this is an important, life-saving, world-changing technology.  We need you.\n\n&gt;Let me point out again that I do welcome research into the thorium fuel cycle, and that I do think that nuclear power is a good idea in general, specifically to cover the base load during a transition to fully renewable energy. \n\nThe first half of your sentence held such promise.  Sadly, you showed yourself to be delusional with that last bit.\n\n&gt;But it's also very clear that thorium power in whichever form will still take a long time to, as the MIT experts put it, \"penetrate the market\".\n\nIt's only a matter of funding.  Had you watched the second video I linked to you would know that China intends to have LFTRs commercialized by the end of the decade.\n\n&gt;So I repeat my argument that it's silly to say we don't need renewables now because we might have large-scale thorium in the future.\n\nAgain, you are putting words in my mouth.  I am pro-renewables, especially solar.  I am very much opposed to thinking we can legislate around the laws of physics, and it pisses me right off that we can't get $100 million for a test reactor when we are funding the various Solyndras of the world.",

SunRun has a pretty terrible reputation.\n\n1) Zero cost to you. - nothing in life is free. A solar lease typically comes with less than preferable financial terms \n\n2) If you ever need to remove them we will pay for it - they aren't going to pay to have it installed and then allow you to remove it. \n\n3) You can cancel at any time prior to installation. - there are plans to draw and permits to pull before any solar install. In all likelihood, if you cancel you will be responsible for these costs\n\nI'd get your hands on the contract and help your Dad figure out what he just agreed too.",

I was planning on getting solar at some point, just hate that we were forced to go with SunPower and pay a premium. Problem was, we needed a bigger home and all the 5-15 yr old homes were priced the same or more as a new home. So we elected to go with a new home and getting what we wanted in our house. We ended up purchasing the solar rather than leasing.",

        "comment": "The question of how long the trend is changes depending on what you're talking about.  Global Warming scientists say things like \"10 years is rediculously short to even consider - it's not a statistically significant trend unless it is 17 years.\"  Of course, it had been warming after a significantly long (over 17 year) cool period for only 10 years or so when they began the AGM movement.  \n\nThe world cooled from a high point around 1945 or so until about 1975, and began warming again in earnest around 1979.  By 1988, we were in full blown \"Global Warming's going to kill us all\" mode.\n\nSo, 10 or 12 years is enough to claim that the earth is warming, but not enough to claim the warming has \"paused.\"  Of course, we'd had periods of warming interspersed with periods of, we'll call it \"not warming\" since the point where measurements began, and possibly even before.  Even though the rate of human caused emissions were only 10% or so of current rates, the earth warmed at very nearly identical rates of temperature increase in the early 20^th century.  \n\nOf course, as a smart man pointed out recently to me, our emissions do not directly impact temperature rise, it's the level of atmospheric CO2 that does that, and the rate of CO2 rise has been very smoothly increasing since we began measuring it.\n\nThose steam engines and home heating fireplaces were responsible for the same rate of temperature rise 140 years ago as our massive amounts of cars, power plants, concrete building projects and clearcutting of forests are today.  Simple things like a mere 10 year period where the temperature doesn't rise at the expected rate should not mean anything in comparison to that long history of change.\n\nIt's almost as if the temperature does whatever it wants to do, regardless of our actions.  We emit a little, the temp goes up strongly, we emit a bit more, the temp gets stable, we emit a little more, it goes up strongly again, we emit even more, it goes quiet again.  It is clearly our fault, though.  The only thing we can do to save the world is to drastically change our emissions.  We should all switch to solar power, since windmills kill birds, and we would abandon the idea of driving cars - solar powered busses might work.  Oh, and we should let China make everything. You know, since they have that right.",

But at morning and dusk you will hit a problem.\n\nA 10K battery will work, if its lead acid then you can only use 5K of the 10k they should only deplete to %50 at most!  Witch could mean  a 1000 watt load for 5 hours straight (that ac wont pull 1000 watts continuous) so good there! BUT its the MINIMUM i would use, try for 15 or 20K in Battery capacity.\n\nNow panels  at Maui (lots of sun) probably 6, 260W or more each (get the highest wattage panels you can) the inverter  forget 1800watts, you will need more just for surge although mini splits will ramp up and not \"need\" surges, that inverter may be at its limit all the time because most lie about their true rating.\n\nFrom about 9am to 4pm or 5pm you can run without touching the battery! Basically all day, only when clouds pass over will it use battery power. That covers your 4 or 5 hour needs!    At night IF you have a full Battery (5k) you could run that ac on its lowest setting ALMOST all night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now you ran all night and depleted the batteries! So you cant run all day because you wont get charged completely, you would need in solar panels about 2000watts   that way even with empty batteries during the day you will have enough solar to run the ac and charge at the same time. With 1000watts its doable but you need to pay attention to you charge state and ensure enough time for charging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The tech and economics has changed dramatically now. If nothing else I can get solar panels and battery backup for my house ... but my own personal nuclear reactor?

Simple example: home insulation. A modest investment with big returns. And yet most houses in the US are not properly insulated.\n\n-----\n\nOh come on. Where did you get that info from? Rush Limbaugh?\n\n&gt; they take acres and acres to power a single household\n\nNonsense. The truth is that it merely takes a few PV panels plus solar heating on your roof to make your home completely self-sufficient. You will most likely even be able to sell power back to the grid.\n\n&gt; Wind power is single digit percentages.\n\nWhat does that even mean? You just have to put it in a place where there's wind. And there's many of those places, e.g. off-shore. Spain and Germany the UK and China are producing so much wind power now that they have to switch it off frequently because their old-school grid can't handle the extra input.\n\n&gt; Without reliable cheap energy all of our standards of living will go downhill greatly.\n\nNonsense. CO2 emissions and energy consumption are not a measure of standards of living, just a measure of wasteful living. The standards of living in the US for example are by no means higher than in Europe and yet the US is emitting twice as much CO2 per capita as for example Germany.",

I'm looking at my PG&amp;E net metering data for past several months and I'm wondering if it looks reasonable. This is the generated kwh\n\nWhat seems odd to me is the steep drop off in December. The gradual decline in fall seems smooth, but Nov to Dec seems too big?\n\nDec: 77\n\nNov: 220\n\nOct: 293\n\nSept: 260\n\nAug: 409\n\nJuly: 490\n\nJune: 526\n\nMay: 515\n\nSecond question: My current True-Up is $165 and I have 2 more cold months remaining in annual cycle. So I'm guessing it will be an annual True-Up in the $200-$300 range.\n\nI currently have 16 panels, so that means each panel is 262 Watts (250?)\n\nIf I add say 4 more then that would increase output by 25% and by my calculations cut my True-Up in 1/2. Does it make sense to add more panels to try to reduce my annual net usage? Is there anything wrong with having higher negative net usage in summer months? In May before the CA fires, I saw peak negative net usage of 135 kw. I need to check what the rest of my equipment is rated for to understand if it's even possible to simply hire someone to add additional panels to the existing system. I'd likely work with the company that did the initial install.",

Is that just an example or is that the going rate?  Solar systems are priced based on potential so does that number change with the size of the system?  \n\nAt the risk of repeating myself, you should not consider a PPA a financial liability unless you also consider future utility bills a liability.  They are the same thing \\- especially in terms of a PPA.  You pay for the energy that comes through the meter whether is is coming from the solar system or the grid.  Further, if you don't use the solar power, it then flows into the grid and your utility gives you a credit.  So, buying power is a liability?  Yes, one that every single household must address.  \n\nHowever, there is no reason a PPA should make a home buyer hesitate.  If you do not want to assume the payments then don't \\- the current homeowner has to address making the PPA provider whole.  \n\nSure, you may not be able to purchase a system, but you are also not responsible for the maintenance.  And if you are in the home long enough it will require a thousand dollars in upkeep.  I would consider that a wash.",

I'm seeing a total cost of $24,730 for a 7.36kW system, which gives you a $3.36/Watt, which is not exorbitant, but most likely higher than comparable systems from other vendors because of the expensive SunPower premium. However, your quote indicates the old SPR-E19-320W panels, not the E20-327 that you put in your OP. The E19 has a worse temperature coefficient than a comparable Panasonic HIT 320W panel (-0.38%/C vs -0.258%/C). This means that for every degree C higher temperature, the SunPower panels will lose 0.12% efficiency compared to the Panasonic panels, which may be a factor in the hot Texas sun. Most of the other specs are comparable.\n\nNot sure how to read the loan terms. Curious what the other quotes were, and why you passed on them?",

        "comment": "Here are two key points with how the system is constructed in Germany that makes most arguments about cost fade away.\n\n1. Manufacturing is not paying the increased rates. All solar rate increases are borne by residential customers. Since daytime energy prices are falling so much - and manufacturers are benefiting so much there is some argument that big business should shoulder some of the cost.\n\n2. This point is the most important one - and is very hard to fathom immediately. More than 60% of that money that is being paid, by the government, to the solar power companies is going to small owners - residential and community groups. Meaning - in the past, 100% of the electricity revenue went to power companies and then filtered in the marketplace. Now, that money goes from government directly to citizens. And the citizenry who are paying the extra cost of electricity are also getting the revenue from it - for the first time.\n\nThe game is changing, as such, the metrics we used to use to measure things such as $/kWh need to change. The standard price you're paying at the end of the month isn't the only thing that matters.",

If you aim the panels, SSW, then you can make peak generation equal peak demand.  Clearly each solar installation will have it's own peak generation time depending on orientation, but in general, yes, peak generation and peak demand do actually coincide nicely, just like TSammyD said.\n\nRather than questioning his sources, how about you explain your reasoning?",

But, what I meant by how does net metering work, what I really meant was: How does the power generated by the panels, inverted from DC to AC, join the power provided by the power company?  And can you hook up a single 250 kW system to the power main entering the facility without serious disturbances?  That is, should the power provided by the solar panels be directed to the main line or lines that feed the facility from the grid, or toward one or several electrical systems within the facility thereby reducing power demand from the power company.  For reference, this facility uses about 15 GWh/year.  There are no demand charges, I think, if there are it's rounded into the kWh cost.  We just pay 8 cents per kWh rain or shine, summer or winter.\n\nIf it's $4-5 in Cali it's hopefully a little cheaper up here in OR.  Anyway, the electrical contractors who are on site almost every single day doing different projects are also a solar contractor so perhaps they'd give us a deal.  I think if it was under $4/W it'd be a slam dunk.  That's really the parameter of interest.",

There are some news organizations who do have a conservative bent to them.  They are the ones who suggest that the Climate Change movement is a hoax.  I disagree with them.  I don't think it's a hoax, and I don't think that many of those who discuss climate science in public are liars or are trying to pull one over on us.  I think that they (and you, BTW) are genuinely convinced of the dangers, and are acting in good faith when suggesting ways to prevent the feared coming disaster.\n\nI do believe that some of the conclusions that some of the scientists have come to are influenced by confirmation bias, but that's not a hoax, and it does not indicate malfeasance of any kind - just human nature.  Many scientific studies have been lead down one path, only to discover that they have been fooled by their desire to have discovered something.\n\nRemember that I'm not a \"denier,\" I'm a lukewarmer.  I fully believe that greenhouse gases help to warm the Earth, and that CO2 is a greenhouse gas.  I just don't think the feedbacks are as strong as \"the consensus\" suggests, and I disagree with the efficacy of some of the mechanisms being suggested to solve the problem.\n\nThis is why I support solar power, wind where it makes sense, and increased use of things like light electric rail.",

There are even studies - one linked below from UCSD\n\nGeneral consensus is it does not pay to have someone clean your panels.  If your going to do it yourself that is another thing.  My system has been installed for 6 years now (12.5 kW) and I try to clean the panels twice a year and at the most I will see a 5% bump for maybe a week or two weeks at the most.  I do it just to make sure there aren't any large deposits (bird poo, etc) and just to make sure everything looks ok.\n\nI would be more concerned about hosing the panels down with tap water and leaving water deposits on the panels. (how does your car look when you wash it and let it 'air dry').  I try to wash mine when it is overcast/slightly raining\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/release/1393",

That may cause tiny cracks or flaking which breaks that part of the surface area away from the circuit. Over the years, those cracks add up and the battery capacity drops.\n\nThe current system I've heard about is that once battery packs are retired from cars, they'd still have plenty of capaicty to work as solar charged home battery banks so you could use solar power at night. After 10-15 years, most EV banks will have annoyingly short ranges, but you can always replace batteries and keep the car going.",

        "comment": "&gt; Have I ever denied that they were working on phasing out their nuclear program\n\nYes you have. You have repeatedly claimed that the earlier phase-out of nuclear represents a departure from their emission reduction goals. Since nuclear phase-out was *always* part of that transition, that's simply wrong.\n\n&gt; Quote the line that does so.\n\nHere's what the actual OECD report says: \n\n\"Updated *data on subsidies* to non-fossil fuel energy are also presented, as calculated *using estimates for financial support and support* for research and development (R&amp;D) on a per energy unit base from a broad range of published analysis\"\n\nFurthermore, even the press report calls the fossil-*fuel* reducing measures *subsidies* (80% of the total subsidies):\n\n\"...noting IEA estimates that *subsidies* that artificially reduce the price of fossil-fuels amounted to USD 409 billion in 2010\"\n\nSo what again is your problem? Even if there was a subtle difference between subsidies and support, why do you make such a big deal out of this? Would a hundred-billion per year government \"support\" be  acceptable, but a \"subsidy\" would not? A subsidy is financial support by the government or the taxpayer, please deal with it.\n\n&gt; Your paragon of renewable energy spends as much on coal subsidies as the U.S., but with less than 1/3rd the population!\n\nEXACTLY, that's EXACTLY the problem. I'm glad you finally realize this. My point was that renewables are reaching grid parity *even despite* the fact that fossil fuels are subsidized to the tune of 500 billion. While you guys bitterly complain about the renewable subsidies (misallocation and so on), fossil fuels continue to reap those same subsidies. \n\n&gt; Looks like the U.S. is acting faster than Germany, doesn't it?\n\nNot sure about that. Have they invested a similar amount in expanding their renewable energy base? But there you are: \"you\" are still subsidizing oil and coal with 2 billion a year—a proposal to end that was voted down in the senate this year—but the 1 billion wind tax credit is supposed to be phased out.\n\n&gt; and are now poised to start emitting more\n\nWhere is your evidence for that? Even despite the reduction in nuclear base power they have still reduced their emissions. The reason for cutting down subsidies is because the transition is happening faster than anybody dared imagine. They are still set on a target of 45% energy production from renewables by 2030, but they would have far more than that if they kept going at the current speed. Since the grid won't be able to deal with that so fast they have to pull the brakes.\n\n&gt; Their solar industry is failing despite subsidies. How do you not get this?\n\nFirst of all it isn't, and second, for the third time, do *you* not understand that this whole argument is *not* about solar industry, it is about the *entire* economy.\n\n&gt; Bankruptcy of German solar firms by date:\n\nYes, there is a restructuring going on—a good thing, the market was simply growing too fast. Those companies, Solon, QCells are almost all still around, with new owners. \n\nThe truth here is that the German transition has enabled China to grow their sector from almost zero, and in sheer production costs they will always be more competitive, especially with their even higher subsidies. Funnily, the German industry has still benefited heavily from that because the Chinese solar factories came from—yes that's right—[Germany](http://cleantechnica.com/2012/06/17/german-solar-industry-getting-hammered-cheap-chinese-imports/). And inverter and other auxiliary solar manufacturers will keep growing, just as will the green sector in Germany on the whole. The [forecast for the sector is a 125% growth by 2025](http://mrinetwork.com/resources/article-archive/articles/german-green-sector-expected-to-increase-employment-/). \n\nSo all I see is that the primary solar panel production is cheaper in China because China is cleverly pouring far more subsidies into the sector. So be it. But there is no evidence of a destroyed economy, or even just of a destroyed green economic sector: Germany is still global market leader in many areas (don't forget wind), and the sector will keep outperforming more traditional sectors by far.\n\n&gt;  With subsidies the price to the end user is 25 cents per kWh...\n\nHmm. Sure, that's high. Maybe that's not an optimal location? The levelized cost of energy (including everything, capital cost, etc.) is [as low as 6 cents per kWh](http://www.quora.com/Solar-Energy/Could-you-break-down-the-cost-per-kWH-for-solar-photovoltaics\n) in the US, *without* any subsidies.\n\n&gt; Why not Zoidberg nuclear?\n\nDo you really think that would be cheaper? Do you not realize how incredibly expensive it is to build a new nuclear plant from scratch? One for which the technology doesn't even exist yet on a commercial-grade level? A Moody's 2007 study estimates the cost of a newly built nuclear plant at $7000/kW. And I'm sure that doesn't even yet include the multi-year delays that you can expect from angry protests of citizens who don't want their neighborhoods carpeted with new nuclear plants.\n\n&gt; What percent of spending on healthcare is due to the use of fossil fuels?\n\nWhy don't you read the Epstein study that you just posted?",

Which then has to have an entire network of storage and transportation in place. PV panels, while only 20% efficient, are now very cheap, and it can be transported instantly anywhere, so overall electricity is a simpler solution. Just one step between generation and use. And we will always need batteries. You can't have a hydrogen powered cell phone.\n\nWhen we start mining hydrogen from gas planets atmospheres, we can absolutely have a hydrogen economy. But we would still need batteries, and we would likely still use a lot of it to simply generate electricity for those batteries. But not all. A substantial portion of the hydrogen would be used for reactors to power the extraction facilities and rocket engines to transport the hydrogen tanks back and forth. What will be interesting is, should we even bother bringing the hydrogen back to earth? Or simply use all of it to make a permanent installation above the gas planet, and then that becomes our new base of operation for space exploration. Energy from hydrogen could be used to produce oxygen from CO2.",

And these fixed costs represent about 45% of the electricity bill (give or take 3%). \n\nMoreover, with the coming EU 2024 Directive, the network fee will be *increased* for PV (since their variability puts a strain on the network).\n\nI definitely should redo the calculations. Here're the household's actual kWh consumed and the yearly cost (again, variable + fixed):\n\n||kWh|€|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020|11163|1530|\n|2021|10250|1477|\n|2022|8641|1226|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>14,500\n\nThanks for catching that! The 14,500 was from another PV offer - I forgot to re-apply the 1st row's formula to other rows. But, as you wrote, I could just multiply the starting-sum x (S&P yearly gain)\\^26.\n\nOn the topic of reinvesting the ongoing solar savings: agreed, but then the S&P scenario should also be modelled with dividends reinvested. Also, any kWh produced over household's consumption (11 MWh currently) gets discarded - i.e. shouldn't count into savings. And the new EU Directive 2024 is already planning to increase the fixed costs of electricity.\n\nThe capital gains tax-rate here is 0% after 15 years. (The 10% you mentioned is for the 10-years-premature roof replacement.)\n\nWill redo the calculations. Thanks again.\nThe hardest factor to accurately model will probably be **government's willingness to uphold the Net Metering for 25 years**. 🤥",

If you need the Amazon experience and amazon prices, just buy from Amazon and don't complain how other people do business. When dealing with factories, business and price negotiations are usually done in private. \n\nAlso, I hate to break it to you, but most of the worlds supply chain are \"no-name\" companies making products for the brand names you know. The solar panel manufacturing process is virtually the same everywhere. It's standardized and regulated by various certification bodies. It's essentially a commodity market. Nobody is forcing you to buy anything, especially below cost.

        "comment": "&gt;&gt;You claimed that I was down on subsidies, then down on China\n\n&gt;No.\n\nYou should consider re-reading what you've written.  You wrote:\n\n    I love your hypocrisy. On the one hand \"subsidies are bad\", on the other \"China\".\n\nYou are now trying to revise what you said.  \n\n&gt;What I want to make clear to you is that Chinese subsidies don't prove that reducing carbon emissions destroys the economy—quite the opposite, \n\nAre you claiming the failure of German (and U.S.) solar firms is unrelated to China subsidizing their solar industry?\n\n&gt;Ah, there we are again. It's always thus with you, you claim something, I show you that the opposite is the case,\n\nYou did no such thing.  You claimed a transition, yet by your own measure the transition is in it's infancy.  You claimed this transition (in its infancy) proves economic sustainability despite the fact that six German solar firms have declared bankruptcy in the last year.  That is hardly a success story.\n\n&gt;Bear in mind that we're at a stage where that countries like the US—the biggest global CO2 polluter\n\nYou should try fact checking before making statements.  China is the world's largest CO2 emitter.\n\n&gt;—is still lightyears behind where Germany is with their transition. \n\nI really hope we aren't so daft as to try to go 100% renewable.\n\n&gt;So the German example shows that the US could go a similar way without \"destroying\" their economy.\n\nAgain, that is false.  Germany's renewable sector is going bankrupt.  Do you think that if you continue to claim a victory there I will somehow forget that their industry is failing?  Or is it your definition of success that everyone buy solar panels from China?\n\n&gt;That's the same with your recurring argument of storage and system vs. grid parity: I admit that those have to be solved, but that's mostly an issue when we're talking tens of % of renewables, not single digits as currently in the US.\n\nWe disagree on this.  I think it is already a factor.  In fact, I know it is in the project I'm involved in.  I don't think it is wise course of action to assume something will appear when needed.  \n\n&gt;Nonsense. Those European subsidy reductions are just a drop in the giant worldwide market of renewables. \n\nEurope represents more than 10% of the world's population and much more than that in terms of per capita energy use.\n\n&gt;Just look at the proposed projects in the region. Saudi Arabia for example plans to install 41 GW (!) of solar by 2032. \n\nThe article doesn't say that:\n\n\"The King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE) - set up to advise on the energy mix - has concluded the kingdom **should try to build nearly** 41 GW of solar capacity, enough to meet a third of expected peak power demand in 2032.\"\n\nThere is no plan for 41 GW of solar.  There is an advisory group saying that such a thing should be considered.\n\n&gt;North Africa—a logical choice for location\n\nLogical, except for the fact that there is no feasible way to transmit the energy to markets that can afford it (like Europe).\n\n&gt;And the wind market is predicted to keep growing in the double digits despite the brief lull that will be caused by various subsidy reductions. \n\n\"Predictions are hard.  Especially about the future.\" --Yogi Berra\n\nExtrapolating a trend, especially after disregarding the lowest recent years, is fun and all, but it doesn't account for the fact that the sites with the best wind and closest proximity to population centers has already been developed.  As I've said before, all types of energy are susceptible to picking the lowest-hanging fruit first. \n\n&gt;So just pointing at those won't be enough for you to \"disprove\" the Roland Berger study.\n\nSimilarly, the examples you've provided aren't sufficient to prove it.\n\n&gt;If those are numbers for average reduction over the annual output, then if they are concentrated to the three hottest and driest months in the year, the reduction during those months will be 4*(4-16%).\n\nOh, OK.  I follow your method.  I looked back at the article, then looked at the paper it was based on to see whether it was 4-16% of annual production, or just that much of a decline during the summer months.  I couldn't locate a non-paywalled copy of the paper to verify one interpretation or another.\n\n&gt;Even if you only believe in your 1 degree climate sensitivity, any further warming will only aggravate this issue.\n\nThat's why LFTR and the Brayton Cycle would be so great.  24/7 reliable baseload power, no water required.  Plus it is considerably more efficient than they Rankine Cycle.\n\nLet me clarify something before we move on.  I don't think climate sensitivity is 1°C.  I think it is probably between 1.5°C and 2°C.  Lindzen thinks it is 1°C.  I *do* think temperatures will need to start rising significantly over the next few years to demonstrate a sensitivity \nmuch greater than 2°C.\n\n&gt;Of course, I cited that as one example. Do you honestly believe I thought that the Epstein study attributed all of the 200% overhead cost to healthcare? How does that make any sense?\n\nYou made your claim in the comment immediately before I cited the Epstein study.  I agree, it didn't make any sense for you to claim that.\n\n&gt;That's wrong. Because the 200% hidden cost is also carried by someone today—i.e. the taxpayer. \n\nOK.  Let's take that approach.  Do you really see governments reducing taxes on households and business enough to match the increase in their energy costs?  Keep in mind that there are a lot of poor households that pay no tax, so a reduction does them no good.  I suppose you could argue a tax credit to those households.  Still, I'm dubious about a tax credit program that lasts in perpetuity.  Maybe I'm just cynical because I've never seen one actually last.\n\n&gt;You do seem to struggle with the concept of this hidden cost on the economy.\n\nI'm sorry you think so.  Let me assure you I don't.\n\n&gt;Also, it would actually be better for your economy if you spent your household income on clean energy produced at home instead of cheap Chinese plastic toys produced in some sweatshop on the outskirts of Beijing. \n\nThat's debatable.  The former would mostly go toward interest payments from project financiers.  Those folks don't tend to share too much with the rest of us.  Moreover, it's kind of a hard sell to households when they don't get to buy what *they* want, even if it is cheap plastic crap from a sweatshop.  That goes back to back to our free trade discussion.\n\n&gt;Paying for clean energy instead while reducing the overall burden on the American health and the environment would go a long way in leveling your trade deficit.\n\nBetter yet, we could build LFTRs and use the process heat to produce liquid hydrocarbons, since we are talking about things that are several years out and require lots of R&amp;D.  \n\nProps, by the way, for noting our trade deficit.  That is one of those issues that will eventually catch up with us.  The largest component in our trade deficit is oil imports, if memory serves.\n\n&gt;The stone age argument again? \n\nYes, because it is a valid argument.\n\n&gt;Does really everyone need a plasma TV in the US? \n\nIs it your call what people should be allowed to buy?  It does sound after all that you are acknowledging a reduction in buying power if people are forced to buy renewable energy.\n\n&gt;Do you really think the average US citizen is better off than your average European because they emit twice the CO2 per capita?\n\nNot at all.  Our emissions are twice as high for three reasons:\n\n- We have a hand-wringy bunch that stopped the advancement of nuclear for three decades.\n\n- We have a very low population density compared to Europe.  (Ours is more like Australia.)  This means we spend far more energy on transportation than Europe.  It also means we have to push our electricity a lot further from generation to end user.\n\n- We still have a large industrial sector, whereas Europe outsourced much of its industry to China two decades ago.\n\nIf you haven't seen it, [this chart](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/energy/energy_archive/energy_flow_2011/LLNLUSEnergy2011.png) is a great resource for understanding where the energy goes in the U.S.  You'll note just how much energy we spend on transporation.  It exceeds the total coal use for the country.\n\nLet's get back to natural gas.  We've talked extensively about the \"true\" cost of coal.  What is your objection to using natural gas to generate electricity?  \n\nNatural gas generators are much cheaper to build than coal plants, have very, very few pollutant emissions, and the CO2 per kWh produced is significantly less than coal.  What's more, gas generators can follow loads at high efficiency, where it takes hours or days for a coal plant to respond to load changes.\n\nPersonally, I have two concerns with natural gas:\n\n- I can't see gas getting much cheaper than it is right now.  Increases in price over the next decade are inevitable, and I'm not sure people understand that.  Still, even if gas prices doubled or tripled, there are fewer problems with electricity from gas than electricity from renewables.\n\n- I would rather see vehicles run on natural gas.  This could reduce our oil imports and reduce our trade deficit.",

        "comment": "&gt; Someone called Greg Barker — no, I’ve never heard of him, either — announced that unless we spend £3 billion of British taxpayers’ money building windmills in Africa and promoting ‘greener’ farming in Colombia, we’re all going to DIE!\n&gt;\n&gt; Speaking at a United Nations summit in Doha, Barker warned menacingly: ‘If we turn our back on the developing world we will see more failed states, we will see countries struggling and failing to deal with the impact of dangerous climate change. And ultimately, we pay the price in British lives.’\n\nGreg Barker is the guy that cut Feed In Tariffs. \n\nhttp://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_091/pn11_091.aspx\n\n&gt; Reduced subsidies for domestic solar electricity production have been proposed as part of an urgent effort to keep the FITs scheme budget under control and reflect the plummeting costs of the technology.\nThe proposals, subject to consultation, would introduce a new tariff for schemes up to 4kW in size of 21p/kWh – down from the current 43.3p/kWh. Reduced rates are also proposed for schemes between 4kW and 250kW, to ensure those schemes receive a consistent rate of return.\n&gt;\n&gt; Climate Change and Energy Minister Greg Barker said:\n&gt;\n&gt; “My priority is to put the solar industry on a firm footing so that it can remain a successful and prosperous part of the green economy, and so that it doesn’t fall victim to boom and bust.\n\nTo be honest I have mixed feelings about this. In terms of an equitable policy they were very hard to defend. In terms of me making a lot of money selling Taiwanese solar panels in the UK they definitely showed promise. Actually when he announced that I was seriously considering putting 500kW in a field in Cornwall and using the cash from the FITs to buy more panels.\n\nBut despite the fact that it killed two promising business idea of mine in the cradle I'd have to say that it was a good decision.\n\nNow if you look at the prices for solar panels they have dropped and you can still get a good return on them even with the reduced FITs.\n\nI don't think the Conservatives really believe in climate change. Rather they knew at the last election the voters did and they wanted to pretend to believe in it to get into power. Also the Lib Dems are all green nutcases and they are in coalition with them. Still the Lib Dems are seriously unpopular now so the odds of them staying in power are low.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that foreign aid was ring fenced as part of the coalition agreement. So it's no surprise that a cabinet minister is defending that ring fencing. Of course Littlejohn wants a much more right wing government than the one the current Con Dem coalition or, one suspects, even a Conservative government is interested in being. \n\nNow I'd agree with this, but you have to be realistic. A lot of very nice but unfortunately rather stupid people thing of aid as being a bit like charity. Which it really isn't. We gave aid to Rwanda for example, which was definitely not anything like charity. In the UK most of the cash you give to charity goes to people trying to collect more cash, or on bureaucracy. At least it doesn't go to [funding insurgents](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/nov/30/uk-withholds-aid-rwanda-congo-drc)",

        "comment": "*Many* of the measures to cut emissions aren't actually very expensive though.  \n\nSimple policy changes could make things faster.   For example streamlining approval to connect renewable energy projects to the powergrid, or providing a standardized, fast, simple environmental impact review process.   This could enable renewable energy projects to move faster with less risk of regulatory hurdles.  Permitting changes for rooftop solar and other measures to reduce soft costs would have a big impact.  Or overriding some local jurisdictions to permit constructing large HVDC transmission projects such as the Grain Belt Express -- those HVDC projects unlock additional renewable development by bringing energy to distant areas that need it, and greatly reduce how often the windfarms suffer curtailment (power production being cut because there's more than needed in the local market). \n\nIn other cases, it's a matter of providing a small incentive to accelerate positive improvements that are already happening, with businesses and consumers still making the majority of the investment.  For example offering tax credits for refitting homes and buildings to improve energy efficiency.  Mandating higher fuel efficiency standards would not cost the *government much* to enforce, but would drive auto makers and companies to roll out EVs and higher-efficiency automobiles. \n\nR&amp;D investments can also punch well above their weight by creating new technologies that then see widespread industry adoption. \n\nThe big costs *probably* come from infrastructure spending, some subsidies and incentives, and refits to government facilities (improving efficiency, installing solar roofs) and replacing inefficient transportation.\n\nIn general a lot of these programs end up creating green jobs and building further investment, so they recoup part of their costs of the investment.",

        "comment": "Okay, thanks for the reply.  Let me ask a follow up question.  You said, \n\"when demand decreases, both price and quantity fall.\"a\n\nThis makes perfect sense.  If people decide to consume less beef, the price of beef will fall, and beef producers will produce less beef, because those who are making a marginal profit from the production will switch to something else.\n\nThe thing is, what we really consume is energy.  The oil, coal, natural gas, and other sources are really just a means to an end.  The plan seems to be that the policy makers are attempting to force a switch from oil and coal to wind and solar - not reduce consumption, but merely change the source.\n\nNow, if we force a switch from a low cost commodity to a high cost commodity, all else being equal, this should reduce consumption.  The problem is that energy isn't beef.  Energy is an input into everything else.\n\nWhen we made a decision to divert a certain portion of our corn into ethanol, the price of lots of other things went up.  Raw ears of corn went up, true, but the cost of HFCS also went up, which caused the cost of a number of foods to go up.  Did you not see food costs rise?  I know I read a number of news reports about hardships caused by the higher price of food around the world.\n\nSo, it seems your \"fallacy of composition\" didn't work in corn - we forced a scarcity in corn and forced the price to rise in all downstream applications, even though there were other sources of sugars available.\n\nSo, even though there are other sources of energy available, if we force the cost of the cheap one to rise we will reduce the availability of energy. Demand won't go down, but supply will, and the math demands that costs go up.\n\nOkay, let's address the temporary tax subsidy for alternative energy sources.  I agree that this will cause a shift in energy production.  In my opinion, this is the ONLY way we can shift the long-term production of energy.  A tax on coal, for example, which is applied directly as a subsidy on solar will cause more solar power sources to be built.  As more solar power is available, there will be less need for coal.  Eventually, there's a break-even.\n\nThere are two technological drawbacks to this that have nothing to do with economics.  One is that solar power only works during the day, and in the absence of clouds.  Wind is intermittent, but with much less predictability. The consequence of this is that we need to build much more capability than we need instantaneously, and we need a way to store the energy that is produced in bursts so that it can be delivered when it's needed.  We currently do not have highly efficient batteries in quantities needed. We can build batteries, but the efficiency is not great, and good efficiency is expensive.\n\nThe second drawback is that while coal can be loaded onto a train and trucked to where it's needed, sunlight is great in a lot of places where people don't live, and not so great in some places where there is a great need for energy.  We lose a lot of energy transmitting the power from one place to another.  \n\nFortunately, there may be an answer to the energy storage and distribution problem in development.  We are working on it, and one day we may just have a viable answer, both economically and technologically.\n\nBy the way, you said, \"All economies around the world face essentially the same energy price.\"  This is demonstratively not true.  Oil is traded on the open market, and when oil is purchased across the ocean by a huge country such as the United States or Australia, they get the commodity pricing.  Are you suggesting, however, that the island of St. Barts pays the same for *energy* as the United States does?\n\nI've been out of the country to several small, poor nations.  One of the universal constants is that some things are much more expensive due to the cost of energy.  Am I to understand that in those countries, someone's simply making an obscene amount of profit by charging two or three times what people in larger countries charge?",

It is not a good solution , especially with a world population of 7B .\n\nElectric cars are expensive in capital terms and are not a cost effective solution . Also , like a lot of solutions that are supposed to generate minimal pollution and CO2 they actually don't save any - CO2 particularly - due to their manufacture process .\n\nTheoretically a hydrogen based economy would be a good way to go . The hydrogen could be easily manufactured from water - such as sea water - and this can be done using a variety of methods including solar and wind power . When burnt it would produce water which can either be expelled or be drunk - pollution free . The main problem with hydrogen is its explosive nature .",

Of course they say they want to stop that minor factor from rising further, but it is certainly not the case that these 12 Euro per month for a 4-person household lead to 800000 households not being able to pay their bills.\n\nGiven that [in 2001 40% of German households were single](http://www.mea.mpisoc.mpg.de/uploads/user_mea_discussionpapers/iz3wgwtfizbj8uq9_88-05.pdf) €144/year is more than pocket change. Also, the article doesn't mention amounts, potentially the increase is more than €12/month.",

EG you automatically make money if you set it up correctly. The million mile battery is around the corner, and even current Tesla batteries show very little degradation. It is actually on the Tesla forums if you look, lots of owners are very excited about leasing and or using their batteries to save money. Especially the urbanite who only travels 1000 miles a year. They will generally be dead before their Tesla battery wears out!",

        "comment": "I got into it by doing a couple of things. First I had some job experience in a couple of key areas that tie in well with the industry - technology and finance. Then in 2008 I quit my finance job and started a mechanical engineering degree. Got ym associates and started a small solar construction company (that failed). Then I started a small website trying to get microfinance for solar power.\n\nThey saw these experiences plus my drive as great reasons to hire me.\n\nSo I guess the key would be to first get some experience - however you can. Intern, start as the garbage man in a solar company or even better - be labor in job installs. Whatever you can do to get in. Keep learning as much as you can while being paid shit money (that's your job as a college newb). And just push - and don't stop pushing because there are a lot of people who want your job (no matter how shitty you think it is).\n\nLastly - have some passion for what you do. I chose solar because it aligned with my hobbies and interests. I read research journals for fun, love high technology enjoy building things, watch intyernationla politics and economics (im a poli sci econ major originally). All these things came together, in my mind, to make the solar industry a good choice.\n\nThen I sttacked - took me since May 2008 to get this job. I tried constantly from then until now to make money in this industry, failed failed failed, but gained experience and a track record. Their resources combined with my knowledge and drive should make for a good business (or so I hope).",

I wouldn't get overly bogged down in license type. \n\n3.  Sunpower... they've always seemed overpriced. \n\nFor southern CA the bids from Smart Solar Design are really pretty good.   I lean to oversizing initially because getting solar installed is a bit of a pain in the ass and those $2.50/w price is decent enough. Additional consideration is transitioning to an EV in the future (2-4 miles per kWh).\n\nEnjoy your future solar!",

I know we have to upgrade that line but we have a couple potential projects coming up that we will probably try to get done all at the same time (Heat pump, and solar) that need a lot of rewiring done. So, the idea is that it can be wired today with the 6 gauge ground, and 3 - 8 gauge wires today and let us use the NEMA 14-50 40 AMP plug that came with the mobile charger and at least get something a bit better than the 120 volt 15 amp circuit that is there. Then when we do the re-wiring to the garage as part of the other projects we just need to run the the 3 gauge wires from the sub panel to the charger through the conduit and then the 8-gauge wires for the battery backup are already in place. There will be an extra 8-gauge neutral at the end of all of it but that is what it is.",

You would be hard pressed to find a Solar Panel Company using Coal when it is just in the experimental stages.\n\nThere is a pilot project to try to derive carbon fibre from Coal using renewables and not burning the Coal. This could possibly work but they just got funding.\n\nWell nowadays just saying you bought a Tesla makes you an alarmist. Ignoring activists and what they say is a crucial part of critical thinking. There names dont show up on peer reviewed Science so why exactly should I care what Greta Gore or Koch Brothers or Anthony Watts says or does? I also ignore white supremacists, KKk, and other purveyors of misinformation. Your point?\n\nWhy not just show me all these subsidies that renewables get or even I  comparison to fossil fuels or something stating that the majority of solar panels are made from Coal. I know somebody in the Solar industry who would be extremely interested. \n\nAs for ff and as a Conservative better to conserve than run out or fight more wars over it. Just like ppl will laugh at the butchery done on an operating table they will also laugh at how we had to kill whales, blast mountaintops, and drill deep into the Earth just to keep lights on in a house. You dont have to be an alarmist to understand Capitalism and innovation. Something regressive are against. Have a gr8 night.",

Its just that those posts may not be in the States, you might have to move to where the research is happening (mostly Europe and Japan to my understanding).\n\nAs for commercial side, there's a growing demand for meteorology and climate modelling for renewable power - understanding wind patterns for wind power, finding the best places to put solar power, etc. There's also interest on government side (again probably not so much in the States) for evaluating the impact of climate change on cities and regions in order to inform planning. \n\nSo there's definitely stuff out there, though it's hard to judge the number of openings it's definitely a growing field. \n\nIf you want something that's a bit more of a \"hot topic\" i would focus more on the solar energy side of things, but again you should be prepared to move to places where there's more serious interest in these things, such as Europe, Australia, or Japan. That's not to say there are NO posts in the US, just that they might be fewer/less well funded/more at risk from political idiocy.\n\nFinal note: forget Canada until someone gets rid of the moron running the place!",

        "comment": "First of all, get a solar hot water heater! It's far more efficient than PV panels, and will drastically cut down on your energy usage. Any house considering solar should first get solar water.\n\nAs for PV, you can do the installation yourself, though in some areas you may need an electrician to sign off on your work, especially if you're going grid tie.  A well run solar home makes due with about 8-10 KW per day, if you're not using electric heating/cooling.  Since you're going grid tie, decide how much you want to spend on a solar system, and then look at modular components which can be later expanded. I'm particularly fond of the Xantrex XW system. Definitely go with 48v inverters, or high voltage grid tied units. If you're grid tied and never plan on leaving the grid, you can look at their direct attached grid inverters which will save you on charge controllers.  You're usually talking $1.5 for mounting, about $600 in wiring, $600-1000 in circuit breakers, $2500 for an inverter, permitting, and $4500-6000 for solar panels -- this would max out your system and generate about 5KW per hour as long as the sun is up.  With non battery backed up grid tie systems, it is important to max out the size of your solar array  -- it is now difficult to get matching panels. If you're looking for more recommendations for off grid systems, most of the same will still apply, but feel free to oranger me and I'll answer your questions.",

Sources I trust put the [energy payback time for PV at somewhere between 3.5 and 4 years](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/35489.pdf)... and do that using data on older panels which had much higher energy cost to produce.  Current payback time number for the southwest US is probably something like 1 year, and 2.5 years in less-sunny parts of the country.  This puts the EROI easily into the range where they make a lot of sense.\n\nNukes might well be part of the solution, but I think you're overstating your case here.",

        "comment": "Feel free to lobby the politicians to stop subsidizing the fossil fuels. I would actually be fine with that.  I can't speak to the global subsidies, but for the US alone (which is the only country I have voting rights in) I would support a \"no subsidy\" bill.  \n\nOn the \"human health\" issue, I agree that the pollution from burning coal contributes to health issues, but I don't think it's accurate to say that the pollution directly kills hundreds of thousands of people a year.  It's a cumulative thing, in conjunction with other factors that causes people to die.  I **do agree** that the air would be much healthier to breath without the extra pollution added by coal.\n\nWhen people start adding in all of the \"extra costs\" of something, I sometimes see more costs in the system than actual money spent.  They add in things like lives lost on train accidents that happen to be carrying coal.  They compare these costs to the cost of wind and solar without adding in any of the \"associated, extra costs\" like lives lost mining the steel to make the windmills, or the filth spewed out by the bunker fuel burned by the ships that bring the windmills and solar panels from China, the deaths in Chinese factories that make the solar panels.   In other words, this is not apples to apples.  This is worst case scenario vs. least cost possible.\n\nDon't get me wrong...I'm actually in favor of solar farms, geothermal, wind energy.  I'm in favor of getting rid of the subsidies and letting the energy sector find the best fit for energy on an even playing field.  I find it a shame that solar firms can't seem to stay in business.   Between improved efficiencies and lower solar panel costs, one would think that we could eventually at least run households on solar, while the more energy intensive things like transportation and manufacturing could stay with less clean sources.\n\nI'm actually hoping that thorium plants get sorted out, so we could have a safer nuclear option.  That would make moving away from coal, at least, a bit easier.\n\nSee, it's a solution that doesn't involve taxing the consumer.  We \"save money\" by not subsidizing a dirty solution.  If the money went instead to making clean power cheaper (as in end-user solar subsidies, not being given to huge energy corporations to make their solar plants profitable) I'd even support that.  I don't want the US government to pick winners and just give them profits.  We've done too much of that kind of thing for too long.  It might be time to stop doing that.\n\nEdit: spelling and such.",

        "comment": "Looking at your quotes, I see 2 groupings. To borrow a page from Tesla:\n\n**Small (5.6 kW)**\n\n-\tQuotes from line 3 and 5 look to be virtually similar.\n\nAll else being equal, go with the installer you feel better with (maybe better reviews, better relationship, etc)\n\n**Medium (8.14 kW)**\n\n-\tGo with option 1.\n\nAt roughly $2.54/w, this is by far the best deal. In California, the “good average” is about $3/w while many are closer to $4/w.\n\nAs a reference, Tesla comes down to about $2.5/w *but* they come with battery storage (which undercuts a lot of other installers)\n\n**Which Size?**\n\nThen your question becomes — should you go for small or medium?\n\nOnly you can answer this question as to which one is a better fit for your immediate and future needs.\n\nTake a look at how much you’ve used the last 12 months, even longer if possible as the pandemic may have changed things — maybe temporarily, who knows. Then see how each system design will cover your usage: will it be covering 80%? 100%? 150%?\n\nSome utilities don’t like you generating way more than you’ve used in the past (e.g. 200% over your baseline).\n\nYou could sometimes justify this by saying you’re anticipating increased energy demands in the near future:\n\n-\tBuying an EV and charging at home\n-\tincreasing household size (more cooking, laundry, etc)\n\nDepending on your situation, even working from home increases your energy use. And that might drop off if you start going back to the office. Or vice-versa.\n\nI wouldn’t dwell too much on trying to “make money” by selling excess power back to the grid. Consider that a nice icing or extra, but expect that it can be taken away from you. Instead, you could look at this as: *if I were to buy energy in bulk for the next 10 years, which price looks appealing to me, knowing that some years it could be cheaper, others higher?*",

        "comment": "Nuclear is uneconomic when cheaper and more flexible alternatives exist, like Solar. Here's a rundown of why Solar is more economic than nuclear:\n\n* Solar can scale.  Solar panels and batteries, the bulk of a solar plants materials, come off assembly lines in factories. Nuclear power plant cooling towers and buildings and other tech do not.\n* Solar panels and batteries can be installed everywhere: inside cities, tops of houses, tops of parking lots, they're even installing them on tops of canals to cool the water and reduce evaporation. Nuclear Power, requires a specific area of land and access to water. Solar be installed in 1000 installations in 1000 different locations, or you can have a giant open piece of land with the same amount of solar panels for grid generation. And the land can be any shape (square, or thin and rectangular, or curved).\n* Solar can come online faster. It's usually less than a year that it takes for it to come online. In fact, you can install a fraction of the solar components within a few months and it start producing electricity. You can then sell the electricity for a profit. Nuclear takes a decade or longer to start producing ANY electricity and making ANY profit.\n* Damage or defects of any kind only affect a fraction of the components. The entire plant won't be offline if some batteries catch fire or a hail storm knocks out some of the panels.\n* Solar produces its power mostly during the times when power is mostly used: daylight. Night time electricity is currently cheap as hell because it's under utilized.\n* Solar requires far less skill sets to install and maintain, and requires less labor.\n* You can shut down part of a solar plant to produce less electricity for repairs or upgrades\n* Solar panels, while their efficiency reduces over time, can still output power longer before parts need to be replaced compared to nuclear. Obviously, 50% output after a century would profit less than replacing them every 25 years, but it's not like the entire plant will have to be shut down because some critical component has reached its end of life.",

If they are reputable and the company is real, the \"special\" they offer you is NOT \"ending today\".\n\nAvoid leases unless you don't pay a lot of taxes (ie retired and on SS income), or have credit way below 650. If by chance this is you, and want a lease, make sure there is no \"escalator\" from year to year. I do sell them periodically and always make sure the escalator is set to \"0%\". \n\nOtherwise it's better to own your panels. Make sure the company identifies the hardware - WHO makes it? (ie LG, Hanwha, Silfab, Enphase, Generac, etc). Many companies are very sketchy when this question is put to them (ie Tesla, and most \"leasing\" companies - Sunrun et al). You're going to own them, you deserve a definitive list. Would you buy a car from a dealer who won't tell you instantly what car you're buying?\n\nI got a ton more. I sell solar in NJ, honestly. I make a good living, and earn fair money, my clients get good pricing, and my company is doing fine. Solar is getting flooded with lease-scam companies, and they're ripping people off by hiding the fees and commissions under a 25 year term. It pisses me off.",

The reason for this being that they can't just take your solar array and sell it to cover a loss. (Example: Car loans have low rates because they are secured by the vehicle - same with mortgages and houses)  \n\nSo, you're not going to get low rates without using equity in your other property.",

        "comment": "One more detail that complicates things a bit.  I signed an agreement with Southern California Edison to join the SGIP program.  This gave a rebate ($2,500) to Sunrun that reduced the total system cost.  I am required to discharge the battery 52 times per year in two hours or less for 5 years.  Sunrun is not a part of the SGIP contact,  but they are holding this up as one reason not to hand over control of the battery.  \n\nThe way I see it, I am responsible to meet the terms of the contract with SCE.  I should be able to do what I want the other 6 days of the week.\nAs it stands, Sunrun has the battery programmed to fully dump to the grid (leaving a buffer for back-up) at 2 pm each week day. \nThey have the battery discharging at the batteries maximum of 5kW, which is above the recommended maximum discharge power of 3.3 kW specified by LG for maintaining battery life.\n\nI would prefer a lower power discharge in the evening hours so that I can use some of the power that I am generating during the day.  This was certainly why I bought the battery and how the battery was advertised during the sales process.\n\nSunrun did not install a CT to monitor home consumption, even though it is listed in the purchase agreement.  This limits the options for controlling the discharge if I had admin access.  If I get access, I’ll likely add the home consumption monitor.\n\nAs you can tell, I am not so happy with Sunrun.  In hindsight, I did not fully educated myself on all of the details before purchasing the system.",

        "comment": "If you have a 100A main panel, then it would be wise to upgrade to a 200A main panel (or add a 100A subpanel).\n\nEV chargers can be programmed to draw just the available current without overloading a circuit (30A, 40A, 50A, etc.) and you can also program the time of day.  In theory you could charge at night when you know the lights are off, the dryer and dishwasher are not running, and the hot water is hot, and the ACs are off or cruising.  If you avoid baking, cooking, showering, vacuuming, running multiple ACs, and charging at the same time, you could probably get by with a 100A panel.\n\nPlease note that before we got PV panels our electricity bill was about $90 per month and we have neighbors that were paying $400 or more each month.  We have one AC that we run a few days each year.  They have a very poorly-insulated house, run multiple ACs all the time, and run pool equipment all the time.  They won't get PV because it's \"too expensive.\"  Every household will be different.\n\nMost of our electrical devices are more efficient than they were in the 1990s.  LED lighting vs fluorescent, TVs, ACs with VFD, heatpumps, etc.  Our local utility pushed conserving electricity hard (turn off lights when leaving, etc.) and then got the PUC to let them raise rates because they weren't selling enough power to make their minimum profit.\n\nWe have PV panels and generally charge our EV each afternoon.  Recently got a powerwall (battery) and our local power company is encouraging this so they subsidized the battery and they pay us for every kWH we push to the grid during peak demand in the evenings  If each house has generation (PV) and storage (battery), they don't have to upgrade their capacity.",

New York is okay and that's pretty much it as far as the good deals go that I know of. They do not benefit renters because the participation costs are paid upfront and you get paid back over a looooong time. The model only works because the buy-in costs for participation are fairly cheap and alot of people want to help.\n\nIf you would like to be more directly involved in real community solar, consider buying SRECs from local array owners. Local SRECs start at around $0.04/kWh and go down with volume. You could also throw in some stupid cheap wind at $0.002/kWh to get to a 100% renewable + local offset pretty cheap.",

        "comment": "&gt;Currently, it's around 0.17 degrees/decade.\n\nI can see why the IPCC picked 0.17 to report in 2007.  It made sense, at the time.  \n\nI'm going to use the NCDC/NOAA dataset, even though I think it's a bit high for discussion. We are currently sitting at around 0.55 degrees above the line (less in the last few months, but more in 2010, so we'll average it to half a degree). If we go back 3 decades,  to 1981, it is indeed about 0.17 degrees per decade.  If we go back four decades, it's only about 0.12 degrees per decade.  If we go back 5 decades, the current rise in temperature is .08 degrees per decade.  If we go back 6 decades, to 1951, the slope becomes 0.085 degrees per decade.\n\nAt 7 decades we are looking at 0.057 degrees per decade for a long term average.  \n\nThe only way we get 0.17 as a rate of increase is to ignore any year before 1979.  It's a 0.51 degree increase in 30 years.  It is the maximum increase we've seen in the last 130, not the average increase in the last 130, if we use a minimum of 30 year time span to calculate the increase.\n\nPick any 40 year period or 50 or 60 or 70 year period in the last 100 years, and calculate the rate of increase in smoothed temperatures (use, say, a 13 year moving average to arrive at your smoothed figures) and you will see that the increase is not 0.17 degrees per decade.  For the dates after 2001, simply use half a degree as your \"average.\"\n\nNow, I'm on the cusp of thinking that you're right, and the Majority of warming (51% or more) has been due to CO2.  If so, to maintain that 0.17 degree of warming, we can't have many more years of relatively flat temperatures.  If we have, say, three more years without some real increase, then 30 years of warming from 1985 will be back down to 0.10 degrees per decade, averaged over 30 years.\n\nThe thing is, over the entire global warming period, well over 100 years, we've yet to go average over a single degree above the coldest average temperature recorded. Again referring to the NOAA chart, the coldest was around -0.39 or so, and we're only about 0.55 above.  If we're warming at 1.7 per century, shouldn't we be warmer?  Or is the LONG TERM average lower, as I claimed?\n\nIf half of the warming (that 0.17 degrees per decade you mentioned) is not caused by CO2, then it just may reverse in the coming decades.  It might not, of course, but if it is a naturally occurring fluctuation, then it might fluctuate back to a cool phase.  That could be occurring now.  If that's the case, then we may not be at a dangerous level of temperature by 2100.\n\nWhy does this matter?  Well, lets think of it this way; in 1912, most people did not own cars or have electricity in their homes.  Jet engines had not been invented, nor had PV solar panels.  What technology might await us in the next 100 years?  Surely someone will come up with a better way to heat our homes, move our products around and allow us to live a modern life in the next century.\n\nIn the meantime, I think I've expressed the fact that I'm all for conservation where it makes sense, electric transportation, solar PV, wind farms, etc. to supplement our existing infrastructure.  As these things get built, and as oil becomes more and more expensive to produce economically, there will be a natural shift away from fossil fuel based energy.  \n\nI think we have more time to deal with this problem than has been suggested.  I'm not claiming that it is completely wrong, nor that we can continue to burn coal forever without consequences.  It's just the pace of the thing that I think is exaggerated. All these claims of sinking islands and millions of climate refugees, drowning polar bears and snow being \"a thing of the past.\"  Scare tactics are the tools of con men, not scientists.",

        "comment": "So...\n\nAs the others have suggested, the common touchpoint with solar is cost per size - i.e. Dollar per watt.  \n\n*  There is no functional difference of quality/caliber between who's makign the watts.  And your Sunpowers are costing you 2k+ for no practical boon.  Sunpowers only really come into play, in my humble opinion, when rooftop space is limited &amp; there's an overwhelming need to produce high numbers.  \n\n*  Production estimates - likely they are in-house produced.  Head over to PV Watts, and make sure their estimates are with in 5-8% of PVWatts.  \n* accuracy is a bit of a squiggly thing.  My company now is getting some pushback from some customers because we've had a really rainy month.  So they look at our projections and say \"aha! we should be way up here\".  But we look at the sky and say \"go push those clouds away.\"\n* I don't trust the #'s listed for your sunpower production.  They're almost as high as your LG's are low - but I'm comfortable when companies project low.\n\n*  Anyhow.  My opinion would be that the sunpowers can't give you enough juice to warrant the cost.  The LG's are a fine panel and are solidly leading your $/w comparison.  \n\n*  It's too bad the LG's are on enphase.  Get those on a string inverter and you can pull your $/w down further.   \n\nIs there any reason there's not a string inverter option?\n\nAnyhow.  just some random thoughts, apparently.",

        "comment": "I agree with most of the things you are saying (as they are facts). I like microinverters, and some new ones are coming out that don't have E-Caps but instead use high-voltage modules to reduce the step-up required (670 years MTBF reported at SPIE solar). E-Caps are a serious question for me- I'm not saying they can't work for 25 years, I am saying at their use conditions there are reliability concerns. \n\nAlso where are SMA microinverters? I see all sorts of product announcements about new microinverters, but I can only buy Enphase and Enecsys (and unison if I buy a BenQ panel). When I can get SMA micros I will feel more comfortable.\n\nBut we started talking about CPV. CPV is ONLY utility scale. Whether it's Sunpower's C7 or Evonik's Ventana line I don't care, they are not consumer products. One could make power optimizers or new microinverter architecture built for CPV without too much trouble.\n\nYou attacked CPV on the basis of microinverters, and I think that at this time that is not a particularly valid argument. I think that lifetime performance problems are the plague of CPV, because there is no way to do radiation durability studies on materials exposed to MW/m^2 irradiance conditions.\n\nMeanwhile module quality is suffering as module suppliers try to shave cents/watt off their production costs. \n\nCPV offers some (yet unrealized) benefits in its manufacturing process, but is still a young technology. \nCiao.",

        "comment": "&gt; Yes it matters to a prospect of solar. People seem to be largely misinformed on thinking it runs everything all the time even in the rain. Customers have been very disappointed to learn that their system requires grid power to operate and WILL NOT WORK WHEN GRID POWER IS DOWN (some systems).\n&gt;\n\nOnly if you don't have a battery. \n&gt; As for batteries they require large charging currents, also require grid power to actually fully charge and don't fully support high wattage appliances with out much more battery storage aka many more VERY EXPENSIVE batteries. People hear \"solar power\" and get all jolly but rarely understand how it actually operates &amp; the requirements to make it efficient for them.\n&gt; \nBatteries don't have a problem fully supporting high wattage appliances. Unless you're talking about an A/C unit. A right sized system will be about the cost of your power usage costs (at least with Tesla systems) and will handle any loads you currently have.\n\n&gt; I sometimes get the \"snake oil\" vibes from certain people pushing solar power. Solar is great but it is not an 100% answer to all electrical power needs. Salesmen have been know to \"muddy the waters\" of important information to make a sell and that is very dishonest.\n&gt; \n\nThe only time I get the \"snake  oil\" feeling is with salesmen that try to sell you an undersized system and tell you how great it will be. Then you end up frustrated and disappointed in the entire solar experience. \n\n\n&gt; I prefer any and all \"Enthusiasts\" to do diligence when explaining what you get for your money. This video was vague on the specifics and would lead to speculation but the poster does seem to say he plans on giving the viewers \"the numbers\" which I will accredit to his honesty.\n\nI agree, I spent years doing due diligence, and it's why I got exactly what I wanted.  Telsa recommended three batteries, and I went  with two to save costs. It's been fine. I do have to pay attention to my usage to stay COMPLETELY OFF GRID, but it's easily doable. If I had that third battery, I wouldn't even have to think about it and I'd be fine staying completely off grid. This is summer/winter, doesn't matter.\n\nSo, it's not snake oil, and it's a very liberating feeling to know that you're self sufficient and doing less to hurt the environment and thumbing your nose at the power providers.\n\nBut, as you said, you HAVE to do your homework and you have to listen to people that have been there already for advice on actually living with solar.",

        "comment": "The article is classic EVangelism. The article set the purchase cost equal, but that's not even remotely true. In fact, a Nissan Versa (the gas version of the LEAF) costs about $15,000. A Nissan LEAF goes for $21,000 after the tax credit -- if (a very big \"if,\" by the way) -- you qualify for the whole $7,500. That's 40% more in the very best case, at least when comparing purchase to purchase. Nissan and others have been heavily subsiding EV leases, so in my opinion that would almost certainly be the way to go at the moment.\n\nThe article set maintenance equal. That's not true either. EVs have no transmissions, exhaust system, or oil changes. That adds up to a savings of 1 cent per mile. But they have batteries that will eventually have to be replaced. If they're not replaced, then the lower value will be factored into the sale price of the used car. That costs 5 cents a mile. Thus, if you drove your LEAF 10,000 miles a year, you'd need to add $400 a year in net extra maintenance cost. Surprise, surprise! Batteries aren't free. Who knew?!\n\nI can't comment specifically on the solar panel costs, because I haven't studied the details that would be applicable here. I can say that, when I looked into solar panels at my house in Seattle, ones that would generate enough to fuel my car (whose battery is the same size as the LEAF's) were a lot more than $6,000, and the payback was 10 years even with Seattle's outrageously generous (8 times the retail rate) solar panel subsidy. And in any case, if they were so far off on the EV numbers, they were probably fudging (to put it mildly) the solar math too.\n\nBottom line: You are absolutely correct to be intensely skeptical of the arithmetic in that article. I wouldn't trust it any farther than I could throw it.",

Hey we have spent the buffer, now please do not do what we did.\n\nIts utterly stupid. If anything China is doing quite a bit to keep its emissions in check, while developed nations are spending more energy on trying to figure out how many ganders where are rather than advancing technology and infrastructure.\n\nI have a solar array on my roof. 10kw. Panels - created and made in china, Inverter - created  made in china. China currently makes the best car batteries, adds more solar capacity when every other nation combined. If anything I do not see China as a problem in overall context. Its emissions per capita are lower than EU or USA.",

        "comment": "last time this was posted, i wrote this, based on the top actions listed at drawdown.\n\nif you want to take action right now, here are five easy things you can do:\n\n* **vote and campaign for politicians that have strong climate policies.** in the united states, [this means voting for democrats.](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/15/18624294/renewable-energy-policy-cities-states) even if a candidate doesn't have a strong stance on climate change, more democrats mean more chances for someone who does.\n\n* **buy air conditioners that use natural refrigerants like ammonium or propane, and dispose of end-of-life units responsibly.** if you live in a high-income country, these options are available today. [here's how to dispose of your unit](https://thewirecutter.com/blog/how-to-dispose-of-a-window-ac-unit/).\n\n* **eat more plant-based food** and reduce your animal-derived consumption. just by reducing your meat consumption, you could [reduce your carbon footprint by almost 2000 pounds per year](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/2/5865109/study-going-vegetarian-could-cut-your-food-carbon-footprint-in-half). going vegetarian could cut it in half.\n\n* **install solar panels** if you can afford it. [installing solar frequently leads to your neighbors doing it, too](https://www.vox.com/2014/10/24/7059995/solar-power-is-contagious-neighbor-effects-panels-installation).\n\n* support organizations that are taking climate action in ways that you cannot. here are some suggestions:\n   * [Global Fund for Women](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=7340&amp;from=HotTopic-Grouped&amp;fromlistid=203): promoting education and family planning for women internationally\n   * [International Women's Health Coalition](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=7733&amp;from=HotTopic-Grouped&amp;fromlistid=203): promoting women's health and family planning internationally\n   * [Environmental Defense Fund](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3671&amp;fromlistid=434): you know this one\n   * [350.org](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=16289&amp;fromlistid=434): despite the now-ironic name, still a good climate group\n   * [Trees for the Future](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=11443): combination reforestation and sustainable agriculture in developing countries\n\nhere's one more thing: take action and talk about it. most people don't think about climate change, don't understand climate change, or feel powerless to make meaningful changes. if you tell people what you're doing and why it helps, you give them the sense that they can make changes too. if we all suffer in silence, nothing changes.\n\nthere's a quote from buckminster fuller that really struck a chord to me as i was struggling with my own depression over climate change:\n\n&gt; And there’s a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It’s a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. **Society thinks it’s going right by you, that it’s left you altogether. But [...] the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go.** So I said, “Call me Trim Tab.”\n\nbe the trim tab in your life. be the person your friends think of as \"that climate change person,\" so when they get those same feelings you had that brought you here, you can help. [i made a little poster that i put on my fridge](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sop754upd972jen/trim-tab.pdf?dl=0) that reminds me every day that it's not hopeless, and i can make a difference.",

As for environment impact, even with material mining, manufacturing, and coal electric power plants factored in, present day EVs are still better compared to a typical ICEV over the course of 10-15 years of usage.  There’s an intersection around that time frame just due to fossil fuels.  And for people who only care about their wallets and not the environment, the timeframe is around the same where you on average save more on energy by ditching highly volatile petrol markets.  And this is not even touching on the synergy of installing solar panels at home which pay for themselves in 3-7 years and become profit generators.\n\nSo yea, to people like the OP, they gotta get with the times or get left behind.",

I did spin through the net to try and verify the claim and clearly did not factor the last sentence in the report.\n\nWhat I did find while searching the internet (and looking at the available product) is the difference in the current cell efficiency used in production panels v bleeding edge research. They are still sitting at the low to mid teens. The best I could find was a panel using a cell with an efficiency 19.3% (SunPower). There also appears to be a lag between what is available from the manufacturer and what is being installed. I guess there is some way to go before we see cells with 20%+ efficiency on a roof. A 12 panel solution at 15% efficiency translates into a 9 panel solution at 20%",

        "comment": "lol Did you even read those?\n\n&gt;\"Without the huge government subsidies for fossil fuels, wouldn’t they be eclipsed by renewables? The answer, for now, is no. So far renewables just can’t provide enough fuel and power to displace fossil fuels. The infrastructure to make and distribute them isn’t adequate, and many renewables have shortcomings that can make them difficult to work with–solar panels, for example, only generate electricity when the sun is out. If the fossil fuel subsidies disappear, gasoline and electricity prices will increase. That will help renewables compete, and increase in scale, but it will take years–likely decades–for them to reach levels high enough to replace all fossil fuels.\"\n\nSo why are you pretending like this is a done deal and happening right now?\n\nThe second one...\n\n&gt;\"Success this year was driven largely by the utility-scale segment, which was bolstered by a pipeline of projects initially hedging against the extension of the federal Investment Tax Credit.\"\n\nWhy does there need to be huge tax credits to motivate people to get something, if it's already succeeding under normal market practices?\n\nI can play the link game too...\n\nIvanpah Solar Plant Burning Gas... http://www.pe.com/2017/01/23/ivanpah-solar-plant-built-to-limit-greenhouse-gases-is-burning-more-natural-gas/\n\nIvanpah May be Forced to Shut Down... https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivanpah-solar-plant-may-be-forced-to-shut-down-1458170858\n\nIvanpah asks for bailout... http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/google-asks-bailout-federally-funded-solar-plant/\n\nIvanpah kills 6000 birds a year... http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-solar-bird-deaths-20160831-snap-story.html\n\nIf a single oil related facility killed 6000 birds a year, people would be losing their shit over it.\n\nYou're also comparing apples and oranges. Any subsidies there might be to fossil fuel, covers way more things than solar and wind does. All you're talking about with that is electricity. Fossil fuel covers that AND trucks, ships, planes... and way more. So why are you acting like it's all the same exact thing? There's tons of electric cars. Nobody buys them. What are you going to do, put a gun to people's head and force them to buy something they don't like? Or maybe you expect taxpayers to buy cars for people too?",

I missed it because it did not come up in the search... unless it is several pages down. I just searched e-bay again with \"solar power kit\" and \"solar power kit complete\" and the above did not come up... just small systems and such... I also tried \"4 kW solar power kit\" and ended up listings for log cabin kits with solar and wind (tempting).\n\nWhat search terms did you use? Hence, my frustration in finding something that fits the budget.\n\nSo at $9800 + $2000 the price works (though still a little high compared to elsewhere in the world... I am still wondering where the markup is?).  IF we go roof top... my wife does not like the idea of putting any holes into the roof; there never was a sealant that lasted long enough. Maybe the HOA will let us mount them to pergolas on the side of the house which would serve doubly to shade the side of the house. Then I could install them myself and the pergolas wouldn't run more a few hundred $. Then I would be around $2.50/W and the payoff works.\n\nThanks a bunch!",

But I do want to share some thoughts.  \n\n\nYour state, utility and connection matters waaaay more than what I'm about to say.  \n\n\n\\- I imagine your system may cost 50k. 50k a year is \\~$2000/year in interest in a basic money account. Are you paying more than $2000 a year for electricity?  \n\\- You will still require electricity when it's nighttime. You will be paying for that unless you get a battery system (which will explode the cost).  \n\\- You will still need to pay a fee to connect.  \n\\- Likely the utility will not allow you to build to 100% of your electric usage. And your usage is likely to go up in the future (more electronics, EVs, etc).  \n\n\nSolar is great. I'm thrilled to be in the industry. Rooftop solar isn't for everyone. And at these interest rates the only way I would consider solar is paying cash and feeling I'm getting a better ROI than if I just invested it.",

        "comment": "Nuclear is uneconomic when cheaper and more flexible alternatives exist, like Solar. Here's a rundown of why Solar is more economic than nuclear:\n\n* Solar can scale.  Solar panels and batteries, the bulk of a solar plants materials, come off assembly lines in factories. Nuclear power plant cooling towers and buildings and other tech do not.\n* Solar panels and batteries can be installed everywhere: inside cities, tops of houses, tops of parking lots, they're even installing them on tops of canals to cool the water and reduce evaporation. Nuclear Power, requires a specific area of land and access to water. Solar be installed in 1000 installations in 1000 different locations, or you can have a giant open piece of land with the same amount of solar panels for grid generation. And the land can be any shape (square, or thin and rectangular, or curved).\n* Solar can come online faster. It's usually less than a year that it takes for it to come online. In fact, you can install a fraction of the solar components within a few months and it start producing electricity. You can then sell the electricity for a profit. Nuclear takes a decade or longer to start producing ANY electricity and making ANY profit.\n* Damage or defects of any kind only affect a fraction of the components. The entire plant won't be offline if some batteries catch fire or a hail storm knocks out some of the panels.\n* Solar produces its power mostly during the times when power is mostly used: daylight. Night time electricity is currently cheap as hell because it's under utilized.\n* Solar requires far less skill sets to install and maintain, and requires less labor.\n* You can shut down part of a solar plant to produce less electricity for repairs or upgrades\n* Solar panels, while their efficiency reduces over time, can still output power longer before parts need to be replaced compared to nuclear. Obviously, 50% output after a century would profit less than replacing them every 25 years, but it's not like the entire plant will have to be shut down because some critical component has reached its end of life.",

        "comment": "Since the scale makes it hard to see the values for metals other than copper, these figures may be more useful (from p.228 on). It looks like a **12-week power storage capacity** would be required to buffer intermittent power supply from wind and solar (fig. 34).\n\n* For 48-hour storage capability, we'd need 3x the amount of Copper, 3x the amount of Nickel, 93x the amount of Lithium, 12x the amount of Cobalt, 34x the amount of Graphite, and 36x the amount of Vanadium as was mined/produced from 1990-2023.\n* For 28-day storage capability, we'd need 12x the amount of Copper, 21x the amount of Nickel, 1,100x the amount of Lithium, 107x the amount of Cobalt, 351x the amount of Graphite, and 453x the amount of Vanadium as was mined/produced from 1990-2023.\n\nAnother useful metric is the years required to produce a given metal at 2019 rates of production for a full renewable transition (EV's, batteries, wind turbines, solar panels and new power; 28-day buffer):\n\n* Copper: 255 Years\n* Nickel: 533 Years\n* Lithium: 13,397 Years\n* Cobalt: 2,325 Years\n* Graphite: 4,204 Years\n* Vanadium: 9,629 Years\n\nProduction aside, we don't even have enough mineral reserves + resources to create a 28-day buffer (p.240) for a single generation of renewables (and remember that a 12-week buffer was recommended).\n\nWe obviously can't keep burning fossil fuels forever either, so my big takeaway from this study (and others like it) is that **we simply can't expect to sustain our high-energy, high-consumption lifestyles through the end of this century.** Degrowth (i.e. a reduction in per-capita consumption, and likely a corresponding decline in birth rates) seems like the only viable path forward, although our world leaders don't seem willing to touch that idea with a 10-foot pole.",

DSIRE.org http://www.dsireusa.org/ is also a very good website for learning about local incentives for solar.\n\nThere are two general ways to take the tax credit... so make sure you speak with a tax accountant to determine which is a better deal for you.\n\n1. Take the tax credit on the \"post rebate/incentive\" cost of your system.\n\n2. Count the tax credit as income then take a tax credit on the full installation cost of your system.\n\nEither are viable options but your personal financial situation will determine which is best for you. Best advice is contact a local solar installer who can help you figure out what system is best for you....",

In the thousands of systems we’ve installed, only one case has PGE been wrong.\n\nOnly way to know for sure there is an issue is to install a consumption and production meter.\n\nIs the system producing what it’s supposed to? Have you increased usage/changed AC settings/added anything else?\n\nWhen the system is on and you turn off everything else, does your meter run backwards? \n\nNet metering is pretty straight forward, would be good to see your bill (page 3) and also your production report.\n\nWhere in CA are you located?",

Completely different from solar PV, which is highly scalable: the same basic technology (solar PV modules + inverter) can be used for a very small system for your home or for a very large utility scale system (with adaptations of course for large inverters, a special grid connection, etc.).",

And when the grid goes down you switch the batteries to charge with solar.  \n\nYou use the solar panels to both put power back into your system (grid-tied) and when the grid goes down you switch the power to just charge the batteries (off grid). This can be accomplished with two different systems but the same solar panels. \n\nThe cost will be higher with additional equipment - but if you just go off grid those panels aren't doing anything for you most of the time. You can easily recoup the extra cost by saving money on your power bill. \n\nMight as well get it connected to use the panels all the time - both with grid on and grid off. \n\nGrid goes down?

        "comment": "&gt;No, it shows the cost decreasing at a slower rate...\n\nYes, that's what I meant by \"levelling out.\"  If you can acknowledge a slowdown, you can see why \"exponentially decreasing\" is false.\n\n&gt;...while both energy density and watt hours continue to accelerate.\n\nDoesn't matter since those are batteries for mobile applications and are still more expensive than lead-acid.  You'll note your graph ended in 2001.  Here we are in 2014 and lead-acid is *still* cheaper for static applications.  What does that tell you about what happened to the trends in intervening years?\n\n&gt; It also shows the life cycle of one technology, when several new contenders will surpass it and carry the torch.\n\nNone of those technologies has yet met lead-acid for static applications.  I wish they would.  I have high hopes for [this one](http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/the-smarter-grid/new-flow-battery-aims-to-replace-gas-plants), but only time will tell.\n\n&gt;Absolute falsehood.\n\nAbsolute truth.  If I build a 100 acre solar farm, you can't build a 1,000 acre solar farm that produces more than 10 times the power.  Solar thermal, on the other hand, scales superlinearly, so big farms produce more power per acre than do small farms.\n\n&gt;Alternative energy is where computers were when Watson said there was a market for maybe 5 in the world.\n\nDirect sunlight gives us about 1 kW/m^3 .  Monocrystaline PV cells are about 20% efficient and have been for a long time.  Even if you could make PV 100% efficient (you can't), you are *still* constrained on how much sunlight you can harness.  It will always be 1kW/m^3 , and you still have nighttime and cloudy days to deal with.  PV is not, nor has it ever, followed the path of transistors per square mm.  As I've said, even if PV cells became essentially free, the constraint isn't the price of cells, but the hours of sunlight you get per day.  Storage certainly isn't following anything close to an exponential curve.\n\n&gt;Those with the \"can't do\" attitude will see what comes as the next. Horseless carriages will never compete with horses!\n\nWhy do you keep trying to make this personal?\n\n&gt; A 3.8 x 1026 watt per second fusion reactor is spewing free power onto every point on the earth...\n\n...at 1 kW/m^3, when in direct sunlight.\n\n&gt;Wind at parity with new coal in India, solar to join by 2018: HSBC\n\nIntermittent.  \"Parity\" label is meaningless unless it has the same performance of other generation.  Intermittent sources need storage.\n\n&gt;Once all its costs are accounted for, the price of commercial solar power has pulled even with retail electricity rates in Italy and Germany, according to a new report.\n\nIntermittent.\n\n&gt;Australia - Solar energy cost hits par with coal fuel\n\nIntermittent.\n\n&gt;Chinese Report Says Solar and Coal May Reach Parity by 2015\n\nIntermittent.\n\n&gt;Bloomberg - Solar Power May Already Rival Coal, Prompting Installation Surge\n\nIntermittent.\n\n&gt;US Solar Installations In 2014 Expected To Double Solar Installations Of 2012\n\nIntermittent.\n\nNothing in any of those articles tells us how we'll generate power for 3/4th of the day when solar isn't generating at capacity.  If you want to change my mind, show me where solar *plus storage* comes anywhere near coal or nuclear for 24/7 production.  Show me where solar *plus storage* rivals natural gas in price or dispatchability.  As I've said before, solar is great for peak load in certain locations.  It has a helluva time doing much outside of that.",
