Dairy is also crueler than standard meat production.

Vegans draw the line at hurting sentient individuals.

<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 3</div><div class="example-comment">By late next year, bitcoin could be consuming more electricity than all the world’s solar panels currently produce -- about 1.8 percent of global electricity, according to a simple extrapolation of the study’s predictions. That would effectively erase decades of progress on renewable energy.</div></div>

&amp;gt; Had a friend who did this a while back, his dog was so skinny and had 0 energy and got sick often and its coat was nasty. Then his parents basically stole the dog from him and started feeding it right, a month later you could pet it without cringing and actually play with it. Vegans are some of the most illogical people out there. I know vegans who wont drink wine because the possibility that insects are killed in the process of harvesting the grapes....

<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 1</div><div class="example-comment">There is a bunch of roads, most I would assume, not designed to be crossed by 18 wheelers at all. So EVs will double the road wear and thus costs.
This could hit smaller countryside or poorer communities the hardest, since we don't have enough money for infrastructure anyway.</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 2</div><div class="example-comment">Three motors running two wheels? That's odd.
Also, it's hideous. 
I want to like EVs that offer some good competition to Tesla, but that one just doesn't rustle my jimmies.</div></div>

Touchscreen sucks, acceleration sucks, tires suck, can't pass cars easily driving 50, solar panels cost $5000 and add $10 in electricity a year, body panels don't fit, wind noise and clicking driving over 55... And I'm only halfway into his review!</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 2</div><div class="example-comment">the reason this technology will not fly (pardon the pun) is not because of the birds, but because it is WAY too expensive and not commercially proven ... and above all, not competitive against plain old crystalline PV. the global average, all-in cost today of utility scale solar photovoltaics (excluding land, which varies wildly) is around $1.5 million per MWp installed (source: Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a respected industry data gathering outfit). the Brightsource technology is probably at ...</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 3</div><div class="example-comment">The NV decision will not just chase off solar lease companies, it will destroy everyone.  SunWorks has also laid off most of its installers.  A small grid tied system, lets say 2kw, will cost more to have connected than to take off the roof, let alone make sense to build.
With a $38 per month interconnection service charge and $.028 per kwh fed into the grid it will be really hard to make residential solar pencil out.  I know in winter with the snow and less sun it will be really hard to save mo...</div></div>

Way to shift the blame for those deaths and putting it one of of the *few* people that are dedicated to fighting the domination of animals...
As for alternative? A plant-based diet of course.
I agree, capitalism is a great force for domination, that's exactly why I can't understand why someone would see consumerism as &quot;the most important goal&quot;. I'd rather be participating in the a...</div></div>

It's pretty clear, I'm not sure how you could miss my point.  BMW missed by 8%, Tesla missed by 20%.  
I don't need to insinuate anything by the way, I'll directly claim that Tesla is inflating their actual performance.  It's proven out in every test like this I've seen.  Repeatedly.  Tesla will be one of the worst, and will overstate possible range / actual efficiency.
Oh and it's not just me 'insinuating' those points.

Hydro power is. Installing these products, “renewables” is bad for the environment in a place like BC. It creates a ton of emissions, mining and refining creates toxic waste. 
Wind power is terrible for the environment in many ways as well.
