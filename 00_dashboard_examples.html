<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">FOOD · 1</div><div class="example-comment">Can't wait for all the inevitable complaints from the community screeching about how veganism is being rubbed in their faces. The outrage won't stop until they replace it with the usual greasy cheeseburger close up to keep their small minds at ease.</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">FOOD · 2</div><div class="example-comment">Cooking animal flesh and exploiting animals while saying they're vegan isn't a step in the right direction.

It shows that they're just a coward that stands for nothing and doesn't care what animals die for them to have their fame.</div></div>

You get water, LNG, and electric service then forget about them because they are running. You get a car and forget about it every 6 months because it is running and just needs oil change. You get central AC, heater, Washer and dryer and you forget about them and just use them. With the solar, you have to monitor each day for bad panels, faulty equipment, low production, bad and questionable graphs, etc. You cannot just buy it and forget...</div></div>

Just on the chance you are being serious:
*Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly o...</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">FOOD · 2</div><div class="example-comment">My Christmas party this year is at a place called The Grand River Chophouse...
We called them to see if there was, somehow, some sort of vegan option. Apparently we'll be snacking on nachos the whole night and so clearly we'll be eating before we head over there. I expect the entire evening to be viciously uncomfortable.</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">FOOD · 3</div><div class="example-comment">Sure, they were childish as fuck, which should have been predictable. Unfortunately, a lot of people have an aversion to anything vegan, even if it's delicious. And for all we know, maybe the OP is the type of person who is constantly pushing her vegan lifestyle on her family and they're simply sick of it. I have someone like that in my life its it's quite frankly, annoying. She tried to get us to come to get fully vegan Thanksgiving and NO animal products were allowed. Hell no.....Thanksgiving ...</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 1</div><div class="example-comment">Perhaps you'd understand it more if you had strong morals and ethics. When the figurehead of a company is as hateful as Musk and insists on constantly spewing that repulsive nonsense, it certainly affects my buying decisions. Neither of my two EVs are Tesla, and Elon was a real influence in those decisions.</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 2</div><div class="example-comment">Wisconsin zip codes also don't show Teslas as an option. 
Tesla stores are outlawed here due to dealer protection laws which is why I had to travel to Chicago to get my 3. With warranty towing and ranger service it is manageable, but frustrating that state laws hinder buying an American made vehicle to enrich our fossil fueled dears and maintain their fiefdoms.</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 3</div><div class="example-comment">But if you’re able to go with another form of energy, e.g. gas, and our cars can only go on electrons, if PHEVs take all the chargers, BEVs are left with dead cars waiting for a tow. My spouse drove to Providence Airport in his i3s that gets 160 miles on a good day, he HAD to plug in while he traveled to be able to get home after he returned. He found 1 open charger, and the three others occupied by PHEVs. What’s he supposed to do, push his car home?! The PHEV can switch to gas when the battery ...</div></div>

And that was after I bought the panels outright at closing. Still had to deal with their incompetence and hostility for 4 months.</div></div>

Until you post pics of your pantry,  medicine cabinet,  and closet,  I refuse to be defiled by your potentially (probably) carnist congratulations.</div></div>

<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 2</div><div class="example-comment">The Tesla I'm assuming you drive probably wouldn't exist without the ZEV mandate and its secondary credits market, ergo the insane liberal government was fundamentally necessary in you (and people like you) buying the car you bought.
Or maybe I'm wrong and you drive a car that came from an electric car company that was started in some other more EV friendly state, like..?  Oh wait there are none.  Dumbass.</div></div>

Please need your input.. Some weeks ago, i signed with Freedom solar. Today I got a change order mail, asking me to approve changing from 13 Silfab 430W BOB panels to 13 qcells 410 BOB panel.. when I asked, the sales agent said the company will no longer be supporting Silfab panels in the future and that they found a new roof location to place the Qcells battery (which will provide same output).
No changes to the payment..
