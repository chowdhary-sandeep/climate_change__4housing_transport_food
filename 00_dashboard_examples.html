11,000 kwh per year means about 900 kwh per month. 

Electricity in Texas is about $0.12 per kwh. So you're paying $116 per month to generate $108 worth of electricity per month at best. 

And this assuming you're able to use every single kwh generated or find a net-metering plan that offers 1 to 1 net metering. I am not sure those are still available in Texas without a minimum fee or without capping you on how much you can send back.

If it's your first time driving an EV, make sure you plan ahead - which you are doing.

70 miles you will be fine. Bad outcomes include Hertz giving you a low charged car that you have to charge before those 70 miles.

Another bad situation is if that Bolt doesn't have a mobile charger. Don't take it if it doesn't have one.

Practical example, I have a PV system. I also have a community solar subscription. My utility doesn't get to mark up the energy I get from the solar farm. Our kWh charge is lower for the solar farm then from the utility. I do pay for delivery and some connection charges, which makes sense.. Functionally, which doesn't necessarily mean equal price, this works the same way that my solar surplus during the summer works.
