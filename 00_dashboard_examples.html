Besides, I've done the whole vegan thing already. It didn't work out mainly because being vegan usually requires a certain level of income to be able to do it right. Basically, I came to the decision that my health was more valuable to me than my idealism (since my idealism would have meant I'd have to spend way more money than the odd pound of ground chuck every once in a while.)</div></div>

Everything has an energy cost that comes out of the carbon budget of the Earth. We are already way past the threshold and all you are offering is to buy more crap...


&quot;We only have one planet.&quot; Exactly. You keep offering these Utopian ideas but have you thought of any example in history where anything like this was ever done? 

And no, it's not different this...</div></div>

My immediate thought: **Who gives a shit?** 

They already won. Climate change is now runaway and practically unstoppable, thanks largely to the efforts of these assholes. Who gives a flying fuck what they think now?

And for the most part, like with so many other issues, it's what they _chose_ to believe. They shut their eyes, clamped their hands over their ears and yelled &quot;I can't hear you LA LA LA&quot; while we all tried to convince t...</div></div>

You are very confused about how systems work if you think citing the actions of specific individuals is a way of debunking what is being said about societal systems. This is like citing Oskar Schindler after someone pointed out that Nazi Ge...</div></div>

There is no functional public transit here. We are building more roads constantly. There aren't shoulders on the road to ride a bicycle safely, and the rare people who ride a bicycle have a high rate of being hit by a car.

There is no solar. No wind. No hydroelectric. The electric utility legally charges a fee for nuclear reactors that will never be built.

We have almost ...</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 1</div><div class="example-comment">No, it's simpler than that. It's just that the tree-hugging hippie-run solar power cartel has vastly outspent the economically-stressed oil-based industries, which haven't the money to spare to compete with the green propaganda campaign. If it weren't for tax breaks, cheap use of public resources, and years of record profits, they'd wouldn't have two pennies to rub together.
